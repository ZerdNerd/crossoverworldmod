    centralkingdom.27.d:0 "Here comes the hardest part of the preparations - the question of inviting Arktos and Humsin. They both claim to be monarchs of their realms, but internationally, they are not considered as such. Secondly, they both want to seize Greenland, so refusing them would bring unforseen consequences, just like on some May 12.\n\nWill we invite them? Or ony one of them?

    centralkingdom.29.a:0 "Long live the king, then!"
    centralkingdom.30.t:0 "The case of Macius and Children Parliament"
    centralkingdom.30.d:0 "After the Children Parliament has been created in Central Kingdom, this... thing... spreads like a venom. Children in our kingdom also start to demand that such parliament should be created here as soon as possible. Of course we are rejecting their demands every single day, but there are more and more the next day. We need to eradicate the thing from its roots as soon as possible, so..."
    centralkingdom.30.a:0 "...it's time for Macius' rule to end."

    centralkingdom.31.d:0 "At 11 AM today, we have received an ultimatum from Hartmut saying, that our countries will be at war, if we don't either reform the Children Parliament, or delete it. Of course, we cannot remove it just months from its creation, so only a reform is acceptable. Or, we can just reject the ultimatum...\n\nAnyway, Hartmut gave us some time to think the case through, as he probably thinks that the ultimatum will be stalled in the Parliament..."
    centralkingdom.31.a:0 "The Parliament should be reformed anyway."
    centralkingdom.31.b:0 "We won't lick his boots!"
    centralkingdom.32.t:0 "Macius rejects ultimatum"
    centralkingdom.32.d:0 "Finally, a reply came from Lubniewice.\n\nMacius rejected our ultimatum, saying, that he won't lick our boots."
    centralkingdom.32.a:0 "Today, is the end of the Central Kingdom. The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder..."
    centralkingdom.32.b:0 "Well, these are his toys. We won't interfere with them."
    centralkingdom.33.t:0 "Macius agrees to the ultimatum"
    centralkingdom.33.d:0 "Finally, a reply came from Lubniewice.\n\nMacius accepted our ultimatum, saying, that the Parliament needed reforms anyway."
    centralkingdom.33.a:0 "It ain't much, but it's honest work."
    centralkingdom.33.b:0 "I don't care if he agrees or not, I just hate him."
    centralkingdom.34.t:0 "Central Kingdom proposes us a pact"
    centralkingdom.34.d:0 "A note has come from king Macius. He proposes a diplomatic pact to us, by which trade and military activities will be easier, and safeguards succession in both countries."

    #Children Parliament events
    childrenparliament.0.t:0 "Ordinary session of Children Parliament"
    childrenparliament.0.d:0 "The next session of Children Parliament has been planned for today. Deputies filled the Parliament Hall and debated about normal, ordinary things - as neither King Macius or any deputy did not submit any bills this time - and after a few hours, the session concluded with some ordinary bills being passed or not."
    childrenparliament.0.a:0 "Alrighty then."
    childrenparliament.1.t:0 "The first elections"
    childrenparliament.1.d:0 "The first elections to Children Parliament, organized in every school in Central Kingdom, have come to an end and first deputies were chosen - no parties, because children are united (yet). It was decided during the creation of Parliament, that there will be one seating per 30 days; Macius also received a reminder from Baron von Rauch (vel Felix), that according to their deal a few weeks ago, the king will accept the baron as the head of Parliament - Felix has already taken care of convincing deputies to vote for him."
    childrenparliament.1.a:0 "It's time to give children freedom of choice!"
    childrenparliament.2.t:0 "First session of Children Parliament"
    childrenparliament.2.d:0 "The deputies gathered in the hall and first seating of Children Parliament has begun with king Macius' speech.\n'Till today, I ruled alone, wanting to improve your lives, but it was too hard for me to guess what you need,' he said. 'You are in better position to do so: younger kids know what young ones need, and older kids know what older ones need. I hope, that maybe one day children from all over the world will gather like royalties during the Royal Convention or like you here, and every single child will be able to say anything. Maybe you will choose your own flag someday, and like these adults who associate themselves with red color, you will choose green flag.'\nAfter the speech ended, the time has come to elect the first Head of Children Parliament. There were some candidates proposed by very small groups of deputies who clearly were not convinced by Felix, but Baron von Rauch won the vote with crushing majority.\n\nThe Parliament will begin its proper work in 30 days, though law proposals will be made earlier.\n\nSurprisingly, daugther of Bum-Drum of Tungu-Pungu, Klu-Klu, became interested in the Parliament and decided to go to next session with Macius."
    childrenparliament.2.a:0 "The Parliament begins its work."
    childrenparliament.3.t:0 "Second session of Children Parliament"
    childrenparliament.3.d:0 "'The second session of Children Parliament of Central Kingdom is hereby open,' said Felix, when all deputies were in their seats. 'Today's agenda is as follows: first - Grant every child in Central Kingdom a personal watch. Second - Forbid kissing by adults. Third - More Pockets Bill. Foruth - No Girls Bill. If there are no questions, we can move on to point no. 1 in agenda.'\n\nThere were 15 deputies in total arguing in favour of the watches; one said that they need them in everyday life, other added that they're needed not only in school or to prove that parents are wrong. 9 deputies, however, argued against the cause, saying that they don't need them, they will break them or that adults who don't have watches will be jealous.\nThe discussion was followed by voting, and the count did not change - 9 deputies remained against, while every other voted for.\n\nRemaining points were voted unanimously: special commission was to write the specific law, which would forbid anyone else than parents to kiss children; More Pockets Bill, however, was passed with a clause that allowed boys to have 6 pockets, while girls would have only two, which greatly outraged Klu-Klu, but she remained silent.\n\nWhen the discussion on the fourth point began, it was nothing more than a whining: that girls tell on other, spread gossips, are crybabies, are very proud, are delicate, have their secrets, and so on. Klu-Klu, seeing that girl deputies clearly can't take the circumstances they're in, got fed up with the situation and decided to take the floor.\n'In Tungu-Pungu, boys and girls have similar skills, they similarly climb trees, run with the same speeds,' she began, 'but I cannot understand what is happening here. Boys don't want to play with girls, but it's them who argue with girls. I see that there are more boys who are urchins, than girls. You boys are liars, you start fights, destroy clothes, cheat, destroy notebooks, make noise, break glass. Finally, it's boys, who exploit the fact that girls are weaker, harm them, and pretend to be innocent.'\n\nWhat followed is an outrage of deputies, who started fighting each other, with Klu-Klu herself joining the fight, knocking out one of the deputies with single hit made with her head, leg and both hands."
    childrenparliament.3.a:0 "Nie warto było zrobić nic!"
    childrenparliament.4.t:0 "Third session of Children Parliament"
    childrenparliament.4.d:0 "The events of second session of Children Parliament seem to have a strong impact on deputies, since a special delegation of deputies was formed to apologize to king Macius for what happened. When the third session has begun today, with agenda being Red Ink Case and No Laugh Bill, the atmosphere in the hall was much better; this was made clear when one girl deputy received an applause for her agrument supporting the bill, that there should be special funds so students could decorate their notebooks or cover them so they wouldn't get dirty.\nThe No Laugh Bill, just like the Red Ink Case, was passed unanimously, the main argument supporting it being that adults think they know everything better than kids, but if kids ask them about something, they laugh or get angry at them.\n\nThe discussion about adults being worse than kids continued even after the voting; suddenly, thanks to a prompt from Progaz journalist, a group of deputies quickly drafted something on a piece of paper and entered the rostrum. They announced, that they have drafted a proposal of new law, which made kids and adults switch their places - it was named Role Change Law. The announcement was followed by the biggest applause yet, and Baron von Rauch ordered a short break in the session, after which the voting over the new bill would commence."
    childrenparliament.4.a:0 "Oh god."
    childrenparliament.5.t:0 "The Role Change Law"
    childrenparliament.5.d:0 "The new law, causing children to switch their roles with adults, was passed by Children Parliament unanimously, and all deputies reacted with cheers and enthusiasm.\n\nNow, according to current law, king Macius has to sign the new law no matter if he likes it or not - and tomorrow, a new era for children in our country will begin."
    childrenparliament.5.a:0 "Alea iacta est."
    childrenparliament.6.t:0 "Voting on exporting the idea of Children Parliament"
    childrenparliament.6.d:0 "On today seating of Parliament, the project of exporting the idea of our Parliament is discussed. As we invented and are running such institution for the first time, we hold the 'copyright' to this idea. King Macius proposed to talk with James of Enchancia about introducing Children Parliament there.\n\nThe voting on the bill has just begun, and the votes are cast..."
    childrenparliament.6.a:0 "What are the results?"
    childrenparliament.7.t:0 "Children Parliament passes the bill"
    childrenparliament.7.d:0 "The proposal made by King Macius has gained favourable opinion in the Parliament, and many deputies voted for it. As a result, the bill passed."
    childrenparliament.7.a:0 "Great!"
    childrenparliament.8.t:0 "Children Parliament rejects the bill"
    childrenparliament.8.d:0 "The proposal made by King Macius did not gain favourable opinion in the Parliament, and many deputies voted against it. As a result, the bill did not pass."
    childrenparliament.8.a:0 "Damn."
    childrenparliament.9.t:0 "Voting on adjusting the economy"
    childrenparliament.9.d:0 "Many children, who work in shops after Role Change Law was introduced, complained about their low wages. To get their situation better, the bill adjusting our economy, named 'Economy Amendment to Role Change Law' has been prepared.\n\nThe voting on the bill has just begun, and the votes are cast..."
    childrenparliament.10.d:0 "The amendment has gained favourable opinion in the Parliament, and many deputies voted for it. As a result, the bill passed."
    childrenparliament.11.d:0 "The amendment did not gain favourable opinion in the Parliament, and many deputies voted against it. As a result, the bill did not pass."
    childrenparliament.12.t:0 "Voting on allowing children to serve in army leadership"
    childrenparliament.12.d:0 "Many children, especially boys, like to play 'war'. But as Role Change Law has passed, many of them want to actually serve in the country military. However, we cannot draw them into regular army ranks, as they could endanger our military. We can allow them into leadership, though - that's how the current bill, named 'Army Amendment to Role Change Law' came to life.\n\nThe voting on the bill has just begun, and the votes are cast..."
    childrenparliament.15.t:0 "Free Future Party has been formed"
    childrenparliament.15.d:0 "A new party has been formed in Children Parliament; its name is Free Future Party, and it's led by Anton, king Macius' friend."

    childrenparliament.17.a:0 "It's registered now."
    childrenparliament.18.t:0 "Elections!"
    childrenparliament.18.d:0 "The time has come for new elections to the reformed Children Parliament. Many kids went to vote across the country today, hoping that their situation will actually change for the better now, and the attendance skyrocketed. It was decided during reforms that the D'Hondt method will be used to count the votes and divide the seats in the Parliament.\n\nAs the sun had set, the polls have closed, and the whole country awaits the results..."
    childrenparliament.18.a:0 "I'm really curious to see who wins."
    childrenparliament.181.t:0 "We need a Coalition!"
    childrenparliament.181.d:0 "As the results of recent elections have been published, it turned out that winning party, [mai_chp_ruling_party_name], will not get enough votes to form a majority in the Parliament. This means, that they are have to form a coalition with one of the parties that got less seats - but with which one?\n\nObviously, the leader of winning party, [mai_chp_ruling_party_leader_name], cannot pick the party that won't help winners achieve the majority..."

    childrenparliament.182.d:0 "Yesterday, [mai_chp_ruling_party_name] has sent an invitation to National Children Party, Felix, to join them in the coalition they want to form.\n\nIt seems that the proposal was taken very serious, because today Felix has just announced in front of Children Parliament building, that National Children Party will join [mai_chp_ruling_party_name] in the coalition, in order to get internal and international situation under control.\nThere is however a short disclaimer - at most three NCP bids can be voted off by ruling party deputies; one more, and NCP leaves the coalition next day."

'I deeply want this to be a nightmare, but for me and my people of Avalor, what currently is going on in Enchancia and neighboring countries does not fill us with joy; it is an everyday threat, that if disregarded, can grow to be an unstoppable force for us all. Me and my finest generals have drafted plans to liberate EverRealm if the civil war in Enchancia ends badly for Winslow Royal Family, but our economy won't be able to take it all at once. In the name of my people, I ask you to promote our cause among your businessmen, encourage them to invest in Avalor.

But now, times have changed; it's not only Arktos that is threatening our independence, and Greenland is not that small as it was during before the Treaty was signed, with thousands of immigrants or refugees from the whole world living in the country. East is ravaged by a being that we never thought to encounter, a being that seems to be unbeatable in conventional warfare; North is ruled ruthlessly by a peacock usurping the throne of his parents; and finally, the West is told us by Flower Hill to be 'united once again', but surely it's everything but reunification. Greenland, and the Eastern Continent Treaty, is the last bastion of hope in the region; encourage your businessmen to invest in our country, or the whole East will fall to the power no one will ever stop.'"

Tracz began to bump the price slightly in order to lure Paździoch into selling the shop, but to no avail - Marian's stance did not change.\n\nAfter an hour of bumping the price, Tracz got angry, rose from his seat and shouted at Paździoch, saying, that if he won't pay in money, he will pay in blood; Marian replied, that his security forces will gladly repel any forces dispatched by Tracz.\n\nThe argument began to be so heated, that Wojtyła had to step in, in order to prevent the fight between two men; he proposed that Tracz should pay true price of the shop - much higher than Tracz proposed - and Paździoch should sell it.\n\nWith atmosphere so heated, the outcome of this situation was..."

As a result, the shop was closed, and royal siblings travelled to different parts of the country. James last saw princesses Amber and Sofia in Dunwiddie, when he was being relocated to an orphanage in Sardinnoza; after his 17th birthday, he began fishing, and moved out of the city in order to live out the rest of his life in peace.\n\nThen, Prince James said, that he did not want to return and claim the throne back after what happened, but after seeing people greeting him on the station, he reconsidered that, and agreed to take Enchancian throne."

And dramatic it was - today, after long negotiations, Kurakao Treaty has been signed by both leaders; the government in Spalding has finally agreed to recognize the independence of San Escobar, and hostilites between them have ended once and for all.\n\nBoth leaders expressed their hopes for more cooperation in the future - who knows, maybe even forming together a faction to protect their interests in Spalding Bay is possible?"

Both sides have expressed their relief that with peace in force, many lives, that would have been lost during the repeated attempts to invade each side of conflict, will be saved.\n\nHowever, the peace treaty, quickly named 'Central Peace With Honor', ensured total downfall of king Macius, who is now in king Hartmut's custody and awaits trial; on the other hand, it seems that peace and stability can finally return to Central Continent after many years of military conflict."

    sioux.17.d:0 "Every two years (just like the Cross-Prairie Race), Sioux organize traditional Red Ribbon Race, which is constituted of catching a coyote, tying a red ribbon to his tail, and freeing him; then, some time after said coyote is released, hunters leave the starting point in order to retrieve the ribbon without hurting the coyote while travelling on foot - usage of horses during the race is forbidden.\n\nHowever, during preparations for this year's race in Tippecanoe, Yakari, son of Bold Gaze, officially protested against organization of Red Ribbon Race, because it is cruel tradition organized for fun. In response, previous winner, Proudest Cloud (who has never lost the Race in his life), challenged Yakari to set this year's Race as a duel between them; if Yakari wins, the Race would be abolished forever, but if Proudest Cloud wins, the Race will continue to be organized.\n\nWhile tempting because of results of win, Yakari's defeat could lower Tribes' opinion about him as potential future leader of Sioux, and would create a hole in unity of our country.\n\nSo, what will Yakari do?"
    sioux.17.a:0 "Refusing seems convinient, no need to interfere actually."

    sioux.20.t:0 "Yakari wins the Red Ribbon Race"
    sioux.20.d:0 "After long wait throughout the day, it was quite a surprise to spectators to see Yakari returning from the search with red ribbon in his hand; it turned out that Proudest Cloud did not manage to retrieve the ribbon because of losing the trail of coyote, thus losing for the first time in his life.\n\nAnd, as the deal said, this year's Race has been called the last in Sioux history; 1939 and future editions won't be organized."
    sioux.20.a:0 "A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one."
    sioux.21.t:0 "Proudest Cloud wins the Red Ribbon Race"
    sioux.21.d:0 "It wasn't a surprise to see Proudest Cloud returning to the starting point of this year' Race with red ribbon in his hand; his domination in the history of Race has been confirmed once more, and as the deal said, next Race will be organized as usual, in 1939.\n\nOn the other hand, it seems that Yakari has avoided to pass through the starting point, quietly returning straight to his tipi instead."
    sioux.21.a:0 "So the tradition remains."
    sioux.22.t:0 "Sioux prisoners"
    sioux.22.d:0 "A few days after Humsin's army captured Tippecanoe, former Sioux capital, and the United Tribes finally capitualted, it turned out that there so many Sioux warriors that were taken prisoner during the war and after the capitulation, that Humsin had to order constructing more prisoner camps in the southern parts of the Desert. The prisoners themselves looked like they wanted to start an uprising there and then; it was simply because they did not want to surrender to anybody.\n\nWhen the negotiations with the members of United Council to convince their compatriots to calm down and join Humsin in his conquests broke down, the Lord of Sand found himself in a very unpleasant situation, with another war with Sioux about to begin right inside his country, in which Humsin would not be an invader, but a defender. And there was only one way out of this hellhole that ensured survival of the Desert Hegemony.\n\nAs the new day began, Humsin called his most loyal agent, Kayo the Chameleon, to relay special order to every prisoner camp in which Sioux warriors were detained; the order was very short and simple:\n'In order to ensure survival of the State, the prisoners have to be disposed of immediately. Leave no trace.'\n\nCamps commanders reaction was also very simple."
    sioux.22.a:0 "What the hell...?"
    sioux.23.t:0 "Where are all the warriors gone?"
    sioux.23.d:0 "As Sioux units were moving through the Great Prairie and liberated inch after inch of their homeland, they found that something was missing more and more with every liberated settlement: many, if not all of the Sioux warriors, that fought against Humsin's units, were gone; there were no reports from Greenland about prisoner camps being found on the Desert, which could have contained any Sioux warriors.\n\nThe situation was looking more and more grim, with the prospect of [SIO.GetLeader] having to rule the United Tribes in the future becoming real..."

    sioux.24.d:0 "As Greenland's units came close to the Sand Castle, they saw that on top of the tallest tower of said castle, a communication light is installed, and probably is operational. In order to spare the life of an innocent Greenlander, it was decided to use this way in order to relay the demand to surrender to Humsin. Everything went flawlessly, and the station on the top acknowledged the message and asked Greenlanders to wait for the reply.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the light on the top of tower began to flash again, and as the more words were received by the communication units, their faces started showing more and more signs of surprise, and when the full message was received and read out loud, they were shocked of its contents.\n\n'Dear units of Greenland's Army, if you want me to surrender my castle - and thus all of my Hegemony - to you, I have one request. Since I believe you are going to place me on trial before your so-called dragon Kronprinz, thanks to your law, as a defendant I have the right to ask a one thing. My wish is to challenge your allies - the Sioux; specifically, their leader, Yakari. Relay this message to him. I am waiting here and I won't move an inch before I meet with him.'\n\nThe message was quickly transmitted both to Sioux headquarters in Tippecanoe and to the radio station on the Dragon Mountain, where it further shocked both high commands, which instantly began suspecting a trap.\n\nAnyway, it was completely up to Yakari if he would show up in the Sand Castle to face Humsin or not."

Here, he got off his horse, and after a short exchange with his friends and allies - Tabaluga and Greenland's High Command included - entered the castle. The building seemed to be completely deserted, and only the wind was howling in the corridors, throwing sand particles lying on the floors into the air. Luckily, the castle's layout was surprisingly simple and the young Sioux quickly found the throne room.\n\n'So you have came here, to look in the face of destiny,' said Humsin, sitting on the throne, his head resting on right hand.\n'The only destiny I want is to know what happened to all the warriors you took prisoner during the war,' answered Yakari, slowly entering into the hall. 'People don't disappear simply overnight without a trace, and you are the only one who knows their fate.'\n'Well, maybe I know, maybe I don't, they're all your assumptions. But okay, let's say that I know something about their fate,' Humsin rose in his seat and continued, 'but everything has its price, you know.'\n'Stop playing with me. You won't convince me to join you or abandon my allies or any sort of mumbo-jumbo in exchange for that.'\n'If you did not interrupt my perfectly planned monologue, then the things could be more positive for both of us...' Humsin slowly rose from his throne. 'But, since you want it the hard way, then I'll teach you, why I hate your goddamn nation so much!'\n\nThen, the Lord of Sand raised his hands, and it looked like a thousands of sandstorms filled the hall with strong winds and sand flying literally everywhere. Yakari barely managed to take out his tomahawk before he was knocked to the ground by the wind and blinded by the sand.\n'You want to know where all the warriors went? I'll tell you, then!' Humsin yelled, steering the wind and sand with his hand up. 'They're all dead, your goddamn father included! But no worries, you'll join them soon!' After these words, the speed of the wind intensified, and the sand particles started turning into microscopic blades, forcing the young Sioux to cover his face with hands, which were in turn cut here and there by said particles.\n\nHumsin, seeing that his enemy is seemingly overwhelemed, ceased his attack, as he expected Yakari to surrender or to run away; to his surprise, the boy stood up, with tomahawk in his hand, and looked even more determined and angry.\n'If you think this is going to make me give up, then you need to try harder,' said Yakari, with hundreds if not thousands of scars on his hands and arms. 'I would even say, much harder than you usually do. How will you explain this to your subjects after it's all over, that you couldn't defeat a small boy, after thousands of others surrendered even before you started your barrage? I bet Tabaluga and his friends would die from laugh.'\n\nMentioning the name of that goddamn lizard was too much for Humsin, who was visibly angry as hell; he raised his hands once more, and the wind started to get faster in the room.\n'You're dead, you little...!' he shouted, but right before he could finish his sentence, the tomahawk landed directly between his eyes, as Yakari decided not to wait for further developments.\n'That's for my father, you monster,' said the young Sioux, as Humsin's body fell to the ground, and after a short while, turned into a pile of sand."

Tabaluga even wanted to go inside the Castle in order to intervene, but Shouhu reminded him that Greenland's law forbids anyone from interrupting the wish of a defendant, and that it is much better and safer to stay outside. Not happy with this turn of events, the dragon sat down on the steps to main entrance and waited with the others.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes, the wind and all sounds suddenly stopped coming from the inside, which intrigued the spectators, further fueling the chatter. Yet, it seemed that nothing was happening inside the Castle; was there a batlle? If yes, then who fell, and who won?\n\nThen, somebody appeared in the entrance, with his hand resting on the doorframe, seemingly trying to catch breath.\n\nCheers erupted throughout the crowd as it turned out it was Yakari who stood in the entrance; he smiled, and then almost collapsed, but was caught just in time by Tabaluga and Buffalo Seed, who were coming up the steps to greet him; his mother, Braid Night, quickly joined them to help.\n'I did it,' he said quietly. 'Humsin is gone. For good.'\n\nA few minutes later, a party was already underway, with both Greenland's and Sioux flags hanged out on the tallest castle tower; nobody seemed to care that the war is not over yet, but with the sheer fact that Humsin was now dead and with former Hegemony now in complete agony, the celebrations were completely reasonable."

He quickly flew to the site, which turned out to be a quite well-hid entrance to some building in the eastern shores of Greenland. In his presence, the door were breached and the team entered the hideout, finding Humsin inside.\n\nAfter checking that he was unarmed, Tabaluga walked in and saw the sandman himself, standing in front of him, ready for their next move.\n'So what now?' the Lord of Sand asked. 'You're gonna detain me and put me on trial, like your law dictates?'\n\n'No.' said Tabaluga quietly, took of the same tomahawk that Yakari had in the Sand Castle, and hit the sandman exactly between his eyes. Then, he walked out."

    sioux.28.d:0 "The post located on top of the tallest tower in the Sand Castle has received a message from the Sioux; Yakari has rejected Humsin's challenge to show up in the Castle.\n\nAfter receiving the news, Humsin declared that 'he always knew that the Sioux were cowards' and left the Castle by an underground passage."

    greenland.61.d:0 "Every new year, Council of Elders meets with Crown Prince of Greenland to discuss current matters of state and decide on country's politics for the coming year.\n\nThis time, however, the meeting is different from the earlier ones: there are more dangers around Greenland, and even domestic matters dominated with first signs of instability inside the country, as more human immigrants settle in eastern and northeastern parts of the country, becoming a significant minority, and our industry being practically nonexistant due to nation's approach to modern things..."
    greenland.61.a:0 "Let us begin, then."
    greenland.62.t:0 "Economic matters"
    greenland.62.d:0 "The first part of the meeting was spent on discussing current state of economy in Greenland - there were many reports from new human citizens, who were surprised that the country does not have factories or anything industrial, instead relying entirely on farming; of course, there were some private industries near the cities with human majority, but outside them - no signs of technological advancement or civilization.\n\nIn this situation, Crown Prince's two most respected advisors, Shouhu and Nessajja, came out with their separate economic plans.\nThe plan designed by Shouhu includes re-greenlandisation of recently regained Reclaimed Fields in southwestern part of our country, which surely will bring more potential investors to our country from overseas, but also will enrage Humsin; beside that, the plan includes industrialization of Midlands.\n\nThe plan drawn by Nessajja leaves Reclaimed Fields to be re-greenlandised later, and focuses on creation of national industry sector from the ground up, together with building new ports in the north, laying foundations for new navy in the future, and introducing asphalt roads to our nation.\n\nThe final decision however is up to Crown Prince of Greenland, Tabaluga - which plan gets a green light?"

This approach led to tensions between humans and native animals, as humans were acting with disrespect to the citizens, who were here first. New citizens also started demanding new rights, or at least the right to serve in our army - what will we decide in this matter to ease the tensions?"
    greenland.63.a:0 "Grant humans equal rights"

    greenland.64.t:0 "International matters"
    greenland.64.d:0 "The final part of the meeting was focused on international matters - and here was no surprise, as the report was lengthy as hell.\n\nIn Kingdom of Gongmen, Lord Shen has returned from exile and took over the country, installing a dictatorship and completely closing the country from outside world - since then, little to no information about the situation there has been gained.\n\nHumsin still threatens Greenland with his conquest plans, but recently has started to threaten other neighboring countries us well, with his attention turning to Sioux Tribes in the south.\n\nArktos is awkardly silent and no reports about his moves have been received, but maybe that's due to Greenland Treaty still bounding him. Hopefully, he won't do anything stupid.\n\nIn Unity Peninsula, Flower Hill might has been almost completely demolished, as three former members of Northern Union have declared their independence from these communists. Nobody recognized them yet.\n\nThere were also sparse reports about situation in the east, as a vampire has taken over some territories and boasts how his might will conquer not only our continent, but also the whole world soon.\n\nThe conclusion is: we need to work quickly in order to reforge the bonds with old friends and gain new allies. Otherwise - Greenland will be lost, perhaps this time forever."

Thus, even Dio's next attempt to reach Heaven must be planned carefully, from the ground up.

Of course, they are not entirely the same.\n\nEnya's plan focuses on further exploitation of Arrows, maybe even trying to replicate them (even if there should be no possiblity of doing so); Pucci's plan focuses instead on strengthening our Stand users by continued use of DISCs, which, in short explanation, can be used for example to switch Stands.\n\nWhich way will the Empire go, then?

The Clan's territory under his reign remained pretty unchanged until recently, when Tigers have decided to start the exploitation of Gloomy Forest. He was also the one, who taught our new generation about Clan's traditions and history, effectively introducing them into our society.\n\nOutside their home territories, Tigers maintained very limited contacts with neighboring countries of Bees and Greenland, while conducting limited scout expeditions to nearby deserts and into Gloomy Forest at the same time. Ideas were also made to construct first boats and search across the sea for new opportunites for contacts.\n\nBut, as it came to whole Clan's surprise, Aron was not present during today's breakfast nor did not announce anything as he could do everyday; when the lunchtime was coming close, a group of hunters decided to go to his hut, and discovered, that the Clan's leader has passed away this morning.\n\nLater the same day, after discussion on what Aron said about his succession before he left this world, the matter of new clan leader was settled out on vote with two candidates, mentioned by Aron as 'the best possible successors' before his death: Tom, who is by many viewed as natural successor of Aron, and Nak, who was often reminded by previous leader to be less quick-tempered when carrying out decisions.\n\nAfter the dinner and quite a long discussion on who will be better leader, the voting commenced, with the winner being..."

However, with Aron's decision to keep Tumtum alive and let Tib have a dinosaur as a friend if he manages to keep him out of the village, has toned Nak's dissatisfaction down a bit; but due to few incidents of Tumtum entering the village, which always involved destroying something, it was never eliminated completely. Anyway, it was not as big as in case of Nak's son, Lud.\n\nNow, as Nak is the clan's leader and has finished cementing his rule, he can solve the problem once and for all.\n\nAfter everyone in the village was fast asleep, a group of hunters went into the nearby forest, equipped with almost anything they could find or craft: spears, bows, nets and ancestors know what else. Silently, they searched in bushes, glades, under every tree they could see, hoping to find the dinosaur before the dawn, but seemingly to no avail. They started thinking that maybe the animal could instinctively sense them and moved away in order not to be found, but the leader of group ordered to keep looking no matter how long it takes.\n\nAfter a few hours of constant searching and checking every corner of the forest, the group wanted to return to the village in order to get rest and avoid being detected by anyone, because in that case it would obviously allow Tib to safely evacuate Tumtum somewhere safe. Surprisingly, their luck has not run out: just as first rays of sun lighted their backs, they saw the sleeping red dinosaur under one of the trees. The hunters quickly encircled him, tied his legs, and made room for the group leader, who quickly dealt the single, yet perfectly aimed blow..."

After the breakfast, everybody went to their usual duties.\n\nTib, as it was just another ordinary day, went into the forest in order to play with Tumtum, however he could not find his dinosaur friend in the usual places he could be. This was highly unusual, as Tumtum never missed their meetings - thus Tib concluded, that something had happened to the dinosaur.\n\n\nThe next thing everybody in village remembered was the loudest scream Tib ever made, heard miles away, even in neighboring lands; triggering complaints from the citizens. This scream also awoke [TIG.GetLeader] and every other sleeping hunter, who instantly knew who screamed and why.\n\nThen, Tib ran into the village, screaming that he found Tumtum's dead body in the forest. Everybody went up to the boy and started conforming him, except for [TIG.GetLeader], who quietly looked at the scene, then returned back to his hut."

Tom tried to gather hunters in order to search for Tib, but the idea was turned down by the Clan's leader, basing the decision on sheer size of lands that had to be searched through, ending his speech with conclusion that if Tib managed to survive the night, he would not survive the day so far away from home without supplies."

The sight surprised him, because the boy wasn't carrying anything beside a bag with plums and a water bottle, and there was a notifiaction from border guards as previous expeditions coming from the southeast crossed the border.\n\nThe boy said that his name was Tib and that he had run away from the clan due to terrifying and traumatizing events that took place in recent days. When the dragon asked what these events, Tib refused to say anything, staying silent. With sending the boy back being not an option, Tabaluga decided to take the boy with him, to Dragon's Eye, where he was warmly welcomed by Greenland's native community.\n\nDuring the evening meeting with Tabaluga, Shouhu said that despite all of his good faith, this situation strongly reminds him another one from the past, and that he doesn't want it to repeat.\n'I don't want it either,' replied Tabaluga, 'but I have a feeling that Tib's reason to run away was something worse than being an orphan'."

    tigers.7.d:0 "This year seems to be one of the most craziest ones Greenland saw in its history: increased tensions with Humsin (as if they were not already bad), Arktos manifesting his power and might again, and rising threat in the north, with the east being the most peaceful region.\n\nBut it seems that even this feeling is wearing off.\n\nDuring today's patrol of Greenland's borders, Tabaluga met a family of three and a red dinosaur, coming from the direction of Tiger Clan territories - a nearly closed society with which Greenland has almost no contact because of their old technology and attitude to other nations. The sight has surprised him, as they were caring what seemed to be everything they had, and there was a notifiaction from border guards as previous expeditions coming from the southeast crossed the border.\n\nThe man said that his name is Tom, his wife is named Kwini, his son's name is Tib, and the dinosaur is named Tumtum; they explained that there exiled from the Clan by its leader, [TIG.GetLeader], supposedly for 'worsening the atmosphere in the clan'. When the dragon asked what exactly this worsening was - because it seemed to be something serious - Tom answered that he did not agree with everything [TIG.GetLeader] did as the clan's head, and that he seemed to introduce a one-man leadership, without any external advice as the previous head, Aron, did.\n\nKnowing that they can't return to their homeland, Tabaluga took the family (and the red dinosaur) to Dragon's Eye, where they received warm welcome by Greenland's native community.\n\nDuring the evening meeting with Shouhu, Tabaluga remarked that Tom's words give a new look to what actually is happening in the East; and if yet another straight-out dictatorship is growing right at Greenland's doorstep, there can be something even more worse waiting further east."

But now, it's time to stop this endless spiral of hate and death, if we want our clan to be peaceful and friendly society once again.\n\nTib's initiative to bridge the social gaps and end hostilites in the society is probably the best idea he could come up with in order not to worsen the situation, but one thing is sure for certain: the victory will come at a high cost, as the main rivals will not give up that easily..."

    tigers.9.d:0 "Even the hardest decisions must be taken from time to time, and today is such day, as Nak has been called to Clan leader's hut to discuss the current situation and atmosphere with Tib.\n\nThe young leader said, that he knows how much Nak and his son Lud despise his style of governing the Clan, especially at such young age, but according to the news from far lands he's not the first to meet such fate.\n'Current situation has almost got out of control because of the atmosphere in the clan,' said Tib, 'and I want to prevent eventual conflict in any scale that I can think of. In my opinion, Lud is the key to end this conflict once and for all, but in order to convince him, I need to convince you first, Nak; I always wanted to be your son's friend, but he neglected me from the beginning, and without you, chances of ending the animosity are slim.'\nThe man looked at Tib, grinned quite evily, and asked, that if he really wants to 'bridge these gaps' in order to avoid further escalation, then he has to give him something in exchange for support during the discussion with Lud, because there is nothing free in this world. The price for this support could be letting him oversee the growth of Tigers Army, of course without making it his personal guard, because this is the matter on which Clan's survival is much dependent.\n\nWhile this seems to be reasonable request in exchange for support, Nak could do sudden turnabout and revolt against Tib with all of the army backing him.\nWhat will the young Clan's leader decide?"

Boys then thought a bit about what they could gain, and replied that it would be cool if Nic could be an army general in the future, and Nob dreamed about sailing around the world sometime in the future.\n\nSo, what will the young Clan's leader decide in this matter?

The laughs that Lud and his friends had because of that mark seemed to never end, but everything changed (or rather, was greatly tonned down) when Tib befriended Tumtum, the red dinosaur; but said animosity has never truly ended, with Lud occasionally delivering snarky comments about either Tib or Tumtum.\nBut today, seemingly, this can finally come to an end.\n\n'What is it, spotface?' asked Lud, entering the Clan's leader hut to talk with Tib. 'Why did call me to come here in the middle of the day, taking me away from my important things?'\n'Listen, the conflict between us went a bit too far,' replied Tib, 'and I want to end it, so that our clan won't suffer from it.'\n'Suffer? What's that crazy vision that was born in your mind that our clan can be suffering from soon?' asked Lud and started mocking Tib's style of speaking. 'Guys!

'Alright, continue your wibbly-wobbly tirade.'\n'Our continued animosity can lead our clan to unavoidable division and internal conflict between two factions. I don't know about your opinion, but I want to avoid it at all costs,' said the young Clan leader.\n'And what? You think that we will say 'sorry' to each other and we'll live happily ever after? That's not going to happen, ever,' said Lud and walked to the exit, but turned at the last second and looked at Tib, 'if you don't have anyone to back you.

You have to end your animosity with Tib.'\n'But Dad, why I have to?' asked Lud, quite unhappy. 'I really don't understand why should I...'\n'If you don't end the conflict now, every further event will be your fault, and not Tib's. He wants to ease the tension, not escalate it.'\n\nFeeling defeated and without any room for next moves, Lud initially hesitated to do anything, but after a short while, he walked to Tib, apologized for everything and shook his hand, promising to stay neutral in the future."

'I just want to end the animosity with you, so we won't be enemies to each other anymore. That includes abandonment of that 'spotface' name, or any other name that would insult me or Tumtum.

When asked that if someone can confirm where he was, he replied that no human can.\n\nAfter that, United Council started discussing the matter once again, summarizing all the leads and clues and proofs they gathered; finally, after nearly an hour, they made their judgement:"
    desert.45.a:0 "Yakari is innocent, and the investigation has to be relaunched."
    desert.45.b:0 "Yakari is guilty and, per United Code, must go to exile."
    desert.46.t:0 "No new leads found"
    desert.46.d:0 "After United Council relaunched the investigation, no new leads have been found - not only in Tippecanoe, but in the whole country.\n\nIt seems that Yakari really is innocent, and the real perparator got away; or, the strange events were accidents, and no one was behind them."
    desert.46.a:0 "Interesting."
    desert.47.t:0 "The Sioux arrives"
    desert.47.d:0 "A surprising event took place today in main port of Greenland, as the port employees stopped a Sioux boy and his horse, who just had disembarked from a ship that arrived from Tippecanoe. The boy explained to these employees that he was seeking for a place to settle in the country, but officials did not believe him and called Tabaluga to come.\n\nWhen the dragon arrived, he recognized the boy as Yakari, son of Bold Gaze, whom Tabaluga met in Tippecanoe a few years ago during a diplomatic visit concerning new trade routes in southern Greenland; the horse was Little Thunder. The dragon told the officials to let the boy and horse into the country, and took Yakari and Little Thunder into Greenland for an introduction tour. During the tour, it turned out that Yakari was exiled from his home country for supposedly causing insane amount of damage in Tippecanoe and other settlements, while in reality he wasn't able to do so. Tabaluga replied that he believes him, since Humsin was surprisingly quiet recently and did not do anything against Greenland, placing him as the possible culprit.\n\nThat evening, when Yakari was introduced to the rest of Greenland's local population, Shouhu proposed to check in his Crystal Ball who was responsible for this whole mess in Tippecanoe. When they looked into it, the ball showed Kayo the Chameleon appearing near the Sioux capital, damaging things, and vanishing in the night; this sequence repeated for every settlement for a few minutes.\nWhen it ended, the boy was staring into the night with his eyes empty."
    desert.47.a:0 "What the hell did they do?"
    desert.48.t:0 "Yakari reappears"
    desert.48.d:0 "Long time has passed since Yakari left Tippecanoe following United Council's decision, when he was finally spotted by Rainbow in Greenland; after short exchange of words, she managed to take him to Buffalo Seed, current chief of Sioux tribes.\n\nDuring the meeting, Yakari revealed that one of Humsin's underlings is responsible for the damage that resulted in his exile, as he has seen it in Shouhu's Crystal Ball; when Buffalo replied that he can rejoin them, Yakari turned that offer down, reminding Buffalo Seed that 'what Council decides, it's permanent'; he has already reconciled with the thought of not returning to the homeland, and that he will remain in Greenland till his death. After he said this, Yakari left the chief's tipi.\n\nBut it wasn't the end of story, as Rainbow burst in and asked Buffalo Seed what happened that made Yakari leave the tipi so quickly, to which Buffalo replied that the Council's decisions cannot be nullified. In response, Rainbow declared that she will stay with Yakari and won't return home, and then left the tipi, leaving stunned Buffalo Seed alone."

[TIG_LOSING_LEADER] thought he is seeing and hearing things, but he was reassured by the animal that everything is perfectly normal.\n\nThen, the chameleon said that he knows what happened recently and suspects that [TIG_LOSING_LEADER] wants something like justice. He offered help in achieving this justice, but only if [TIG_LOSING_LEADER] agreed to cooperate with him. When the man asked the animal why he should even believe him, the chameleon replied that the fact that he's talking with an animal should speak thousands, but he will also be able to become Tigers' leader at last.\n\nSo, what did [TIG_LOSING_LEADER] reply after that promise?"

    desert.52.d:0 "Kayo has been conducting his own recon in United Sioux Tribes' territories and found out, that recently a great event took place there, named Red Ribbon Race.\n\nWhen Humsin asked the chameleon why should he even be interested in it, Kayo replied that Yakari, son of one of United Council's members, took part in it, throwing all his honor at stake; in exchange, he demanded that if he would won, this year's race would be the last one ever organized - hence this event was so great and emotional et cetera; Humsin still did not look interested in hearing all this, and wanted to throw this yellow chameleon out of the window for taking his precious time.\n\nThen, Kayo said that Yakari lost the race and avoided everyone after the finish, his pride possibly hurt: Humsin momentarily became interested more in the matter.\n\n'Well, well,' he said, 'maybe the situation in the south isn't so hopeless as I thought.'"
    desert.52.a:0 "Interesting development."
    desert.53.t:0 "Economy question"
    desert.53.d:0 "An important question regarding the economy has been brought up today by one of Humsin's servants: considering that many important factories that supply our armed forces are located directly on Greenland's attack direction, there are proposals to move the industries to the eastern part of Humsin's Lordship, so that if Sand Castle falls to the enemy, or in the event of dual front war, we could retreat to the East, get our equipment sorted out and mount the counterattack.\n\nThe final decision, however, is up to Humsin himself. Will the economy be relocated to the East? Or maybe it should be concentrated in the West? Or should he take a third option - balance the economy between the two parts of country?"

    centralkingdom.38.d:0 "All ministers designated by king Stephen have gathered in one of Palace's halls in Lubniewice to discuss the state of king's health; they already knew, that Stephen will inevitably die in three days.\n'We need to decide what to do now,' said the prime minister after the silence was long enough to become irritating, 'because otherwise chaos will grow in our country.'\n'According to the law,' said the Minister of Justice, 'after the death of king, his eldest son should ascend to the throne and rule the country.'\n'But King Stephen has only one son...' began the Prime Minister.\n'Exactly the number that is needed, no more, no less.'\n'But Prince Macius cannot be the king yet!' replied one of the ministers. 'He can't even write or read!'\n'So what?' continued the Minister of Justice. 'Yes, this is the first time in our country that this happens, but in the history many kings have died, leaving his young son with the duty to rule the country.'\n'But gentlemen, the king must know the basic mathematics or be literate,' said the Minister of Education, 'not even mentioning geography.'\nThat said, every minister started adding their own arguments: Minister of Treasury added that illiterate king won't know how many money will be printed; Minister of War stated that nobody in army will fear such king; this was taken further by Minister of Interior that nobody will even obey such young king.\n\nMinister of Justice' face was becoming more red with every single argument the others made, just as he was more angry; finally, he said:\n'I don't know what will happen, but the law says, that the oldest son of king has to become monarch after his father's death.'\n\n'BUT MACIUS IS TOO YOUNG FOR THAT!' replied every minister in unison, rising from their seats."
    centralkingdom.38.a:0 "Is the kingdom doomed?"
    centralkingdom.39.t:0 "I'll show them..."
    centralkingdom.39.d:0 "A few days after his coronation, Macius remembered the night three days before his father died:\n\nHe couldn't sleep back then, due to all of the noise made by ministers, doctors and all guests present in the palace, so he went to check what is happening.\nWhen he walked to the nearest door, he heard ministers loudly talking something... something about him.\n'Our King has the best wine in the region!' exclaimed the Minister of Treasury. 'Let's taste it more, because Macius won't drink it anyway; why waste such delicious drink?'\n'You can even take some cigars with you,' said Minister of Trade, 'since children cannot smoke them.'\n'Remember, that in case of war, nothing will be left of this palace but few stones - come on, you believe that Macius will defend us?'\nEveryone broke into laugther and the choir of ministers raised their glasses.\n'A toast for our brave defender, King Macius the Great!' they laughed.\n\nMacius did not understand a bit from this; he only knew that his father is ill. He decided to walk further, to the next door. There, he heard another voice.\n'I tell you, the king will be dead no matter what you will do,' said someone.\n'By the end of this week, he will be dead for sure,' said another voice.\n\nMacius did not listen further, he understood everything; he ran through the corridors and few rooms, eventually entering his father's sleeping room.\nKing Stephen was laying on his bed, completely pale, his breathing was harsh. By his side was the royal doctor.\n'Dad, I don't want you to die!' screamed Macius, with tears completely filling his eyes.\n'I don't want to die, either,' replied the king, 'I don't want to leave you alone.'\n\nMacius remembered that this wasn't the first time he was in this situation; a few years ago, he and his father were at the side of his dying mother, who in a similar manner, was breathing harshly.\nThen, the heir to the throne felt, as the grief and anger towards the ministers, laughing at him and the inevitable death of his father, cumulated in his chest.\n\n'I'll pay them back, once I become king', Macius thought."

I perfectly remember the night, when it was made certain that my father will die, and you laughed at me...'\n'But Your Majesty, we...' began the Prime Minister, but Macius continued.\n'I thought for a long time what to do with you. I say now: if you want to rule, while I will be some doll made of china - I do not agree to this. I am the king now.'\nSilence fell, as none of the ministers dared to voice his opinion.\n\n'However,' Macius continued, 'I won't take you to jail or anything like that, since without you I am no one. So, I propose a very simple compromise: as the King, I can do whatever I want. You will take care of adults, and I will take care of children. Everything else - as it was during my father's reign.'\n\nMinisters looked at each other, and then unanimously agreed to these terms."

    centralkingdom.41.d:0 "Macius was thinking for days after his coronation, what to do with these old ministers and their low opinions about him; lessons went, moon rose and set tens of times during nights, and finally - he came with a solution. First, he notified Minister of War - the only minister he could trust in this matter - to whom he laid out his whole plan, leading to the arrest of the remaining ministers.\n\nThe same day, during one meeting with the ministers, on which they were (as usual) talking and talking how there are no money, which all of them need for their ministries.\n'However,' said Prime Minister, 'we can take care of this emptiness as we have the needed experience, we are cautious, we know much and if king Macius will trust us as he did before the war - that is, if he wants us to give him our advice...'\n'Enough, Prime Minister,' interrupted Macius. 'It's not about you giving me advice; it's that you want to govern, while I will be some doll made of china. And I do not agree to that, for God' sake.'\n'Your Majesty...' said Prime Minister, but the king interrupted him.\n'Dear Prime Minister, I am the king and I do not agree for any other deal.'\n'Excuse me, Your Majesty,' said Minister of Justice, 'but according to the law, if the heir to throne did not reach the age of 20 years...'\n'Dear Minister, I don't care.'\n'I understand that Your Majesty wants to violate the law; there's a law even for this.'\n'Mr Minister, I don't care.'\n'There's a law even for this: if king violates the laws laid in paragraphs...'\n'Minister, can you shut the fuck up or not?'\n'There's a law even about this: if heir wants to marry while at age lower than 20 years...'\n\nMacius did not wait any further; the Royal Guard entered the hall immediately after the king gave the signal.\n'Gentlemen, you are under arrest,' he said.\n'There is a law about this too!' exclaimed Minister of Justice. 'This is a military dictatorship--! And that's lawlessness!' he added after one of the soldiers hit him lightly in the chest."
    centralkingdom.41.a:0 "Finally, peace."
    centralkingdom.42.t:0 "An absolute monarch"
    centralkingdom.42.d:0 "'What to do?' thought Macius for a few days after the ministers were arrested. Fine, he sent them some convenient items so they could spent their jail time in peace, but he cannot rule completely by himself - he doesn't have enough knowledge. Turns out, that Prime Minister was right in some degree. Maybe there is some way out of this?\nNot having any ideas, the king ordered to bring Minister of Justice - since he knew everything about the law - from the jail.\n\n'Bascially, Mr Minister,' said Macius, 'I want to rule completely by myself and not have any other person telling me what to do, while, if I need help, I could ask someone like you for advice. Is there anything like that possible?'\n'Of course, Your Majesty,' said the minister, 'our law calls it absolute monarchy. We already are one, but it's modified to the point it's a separate type named administrative monarchy - the monarch is designating ministers to do much of the paperwork for him.'\n'So what I need to do?'\n'Your Majesty needs to dismiss all of us and nominate all of us to the respective advisor posts in one document. That's all.'\n\nThat said, Macius, the minister and Secretary of State quickly wrote the act, which was issued before the sun set; the remaining ministers - now advisors - were freed the same evening."

    centralkingdom.43.t:0 "The Inexperience"
    centralkingdom.43.d:0 "'What to do?' thought Macius instantly after the ministers were taken into custody, and he was left alone in the hall. There was a pile of papers on the desk - what to do with them? Sign only a few of them, or all? Which reject, and which do not?\nEverybody seemed to avoid him... maybe he shouldn't be so impulsive after all - is it their fault that there are literally no money in the treasury?\n\nNot having any way out of this situation, the king ordered to bring Minister of Justice - since he knew everything about the law - from the jail.\n'Mr Minister,' asked Macius, 'does the law allow to split the government's responsibilities?'\n'In which matter, Your Majesty?' replied Minister of Justice. 'Because it depends what the king wants to do.'\n'After long thinking, I thought that you and other ministers will take care of adults, while I will take care of children in our country. Once I reach 10 years, I'll take care of these up to 10 years; when I reach 12, then the limit is brought to 12 years; and so on.'\nThe minister thought for a while, seemingly trying to remember something from various law books.\n'Basically,' he replied after a short while, 'it's possible, but few small law adjustments will be needed. Is there anything else Your Majesty wants to ask?'\n'Beside asking to free all of you,' replied Macius, 'I need you to know that as a king, I do what I want. Beside that, everything stays the same as it was before my father's death.'"

Any royal proposal to sit down and talk about their demands was turned down by the leader of Equalists, known as Makarowicz. However, a few months before Stephen died, Makarowicz has disappeared from public life, and it seems that he left the country; this did not make the protesters change their minds, with the clashes continuing into Macius' reign.\n\nBut, as during recent meeting with his ministers the king saw the protesters marching through Lubniewice, he demanded to be briefed on everything that is known about these protesters. Once he knew everything he could learn of, he decided to meet with their leader.\n\nThe meeting was organized on neutral ground, in the mountain resort northwest of Pyrzyce. The talks between the king, the Equalist leader Stasiuk, and members of Royal and Party delegations lasted for hours, and finally, in the evening, it was announced that the agreement was achieved: national raise of wages combined with shortening the work week to five days was accepted by the Royal side, while Equalists agreed to end the protests immediately."

They're going to eat him for sure.'\n'Is there a way to discourage him?'\n'Bah! Sure there is, but he'll send me to jail for inobedience.'\n'And what if they really eat him?'\nPrime Minister looked at the nearby wall.\n'I don't know,' he replied.\n\nAfter a few days of preparations, Macius and strictly selected party of his friends and important people from the court boarded the royal plane; then, it took off from the airport in Lubniewice, and set the course to Pantmawr, King Friedewalt's capital, where it was refueled, and the crew received required maps. After second takeoff, the plane proceeded east, to Affental; there, it turned to Niederdorf, and from there straight to Tungu-Pungu, where it landed on relatively stable beach.\nDuring the deboarding, the plane was approached by the natives, who scared some travellers; after a while it turned out, that... these people only posed as cannibals in order to scare potential enemies away.\nThe leader of the natives introduced himself as King Bum-Drum, and welcomed King Macius and whole delegation on the island; after short introductions, the groups proceeded to the natives' village, where celebrations and great feast took place.\n\nThe visit was so long that a sepaate book (which turned out to be a bestseller) was written, but the main point to mention was the discovery of enormous amounts of gold hidden on the island; Bum-Drum allowed Macius to take it all, at once or in parts - as he wishes.\nAnother thing that was mentioned in said book, was the friendship that was forged between king Macius and Bum-Drum's daughter, Klu-Klu; in return for Macius' unique relations with Tungu-Pungu natives (and promise of actual development of the island), the king of natives allowed his daughter to go with the delegation and visit Central Kingdom.\n\nAfter a few days, the delegation boarded the plane and took off from the beach, refueled in Niederdorf, and returned the same route they arrived from Lubniewice."

Did I do something wrong?'\n'Yeah? Then who created that stupid switcheroo law? Who?!'\n'Children Parliament voted so. Not me.'\n'Why the sabotage of strongpoints was not covered by Children Gazette?'\n'Do kids need to read about this? I chose what to put to the news on purpose.

    #Woloszanski's event
    game_start_event.2137.t:0 "\"Hearts Made of Iron\""
    game_start_event.2137.d:0 "The modern world, despite being plagued by new conflicts erupting on both continents, every day tries to live a normal life. Possibly that is the reason for the rising popularity of book \"Hearts Made of Iron\", written by Bogusław Wołoszański, a well known historian from Spalding, which opens a new chapter in his series covering an \"alternate history\" in a different, yet somehow similar world to ours.\n\nAfter the prequel book (\"A Total War\") ended with Dutschland annexing his southeastern neighbor Chukia, thus violating the deal made by Dutschland's leader Adolphus Fueher, this novel continues the story from the perspective of Joseph Buck, Minister of Foreign Affairs in Dutschland's neighbor - Republic of Polonica - and his countermeasures to prevent Dustchland from further expansion.\nHowever, after he decides to change his approach and rejects every demands that Dutschland presents, Fueher decides to attack Polonica, sending the continent into another long war, with Dutschland leading the \"Axis\" pact; Polonica, Frenca and Buritania in the other alliance named \"United Nations of the Free World\", and Equalist Union of Workers leading the \"Comintern\" pact.\n\nThe book received critical acclaim around the world, with notable exceptions from this being [FRI.GetName] and [FLE.GetName], after a nationwide ban was issued by Hartmut himself, who declared that the character of Fueher was direct respresentation of him; in response, the book's sales in Central Kingdom skyrocketed, making book the first part of series to become a bestseller there. Surprisingly, the new book spawned a new phenomena, with Wołoszański's followers, naming themselves \"fans\", creating their own stories based on the series, with most popular being \"The Land of Kaiser\" or \"Totally New Order\".\n\nSome experts, however, continue to question the sense of Wołoszański's \"alternate history\" series, claiming that it's simply not possible for something like that to happen, as other nations would tackle Dutschland before it started its expansion; Wołoszański commented simply: \"It's possible even here, you only need to look around\"."

The boy has told his father that dog's name is Iggy and other interesting facts about the doggo.
