For La Resistance DLC owners, each level gives a §Ybuff to operatives§!.

 CR_WS_FLO_desc:0 "[FLO.GetFlag] §YFlower Hill§! is a country from North Korean cartoon 'Squirrel and Hedgehog', produced from 1977 to 2013 by SEK Studio. The series is popular not only in North Korea, but also outside the isolated country. Manga and DVDs of the series are available, there are also statues of characters placed in various places (mostly playgrounds) in Pyongyang. English dub of the series exists, produced by Italian company Mondo TV, but only for 26 episodes.\n\n\nWhen §YCentral Continent§! was ruptured by wars, a violent revloution took place in §YNorthern Union§! - federation of squirrels, hedgehogs, ducks and turtles - which transferred the country into communist dictatorship known as §YFlower Hill§!. The reason why revolution broke out, were secret preparations of Northern Union government to intervene on Central Continent. With democracy abolished, Flower Hill avoided turbulence in the form of §Yeconomic crisis of 1920s§! and prepared for the confrontation with §YAnti-Flower Hill Alliance§!, newly formed by §YWolves§! and §YWeasels§!.\n\nTensions in the region peaked in 1932 and resulted in bloody §YFlower Hill War§!, which ended in stalemate. After §YWolves took Squirrels Village in 1935§! and kidnapped Dr Mole, §YFlower Hill Military Council§! sent §YGeumsaegi§! - the biggest Flower Hill war hero - on undercover mission to save Dr Mole. Geumsaegi's mission ended in complete success, and he returned from the secret mission in Wolves' Den, together with his brother, two friends, and Dr Mole.\n\nTheir return did not change anything, however - Squirrel Village ongoing occupation, and massive fall in the Flower Hill High Military Council popularity caused by that fact, §Yresulted in Squirrels Republic, Republic of Ducks and Republic of Turtles declaring their independence and leaving the union§!. Of those, who stayed in Flower Hill, many are still divided. To prevent Flower Hill from total downfall, Flower Hill Military Council has passed a resolution, which established position of §YSupreme Leader, together with elections§!.

These are also the main source of paidocracy (rule of children) concept, featured in the mod.\n\n\nIn the aftermath of Wars of 1910s, §YCentral Kingdom§! became landlocked country.

However, with §YStephen I§! ascension to the throne in 1923, the situation began to cool down; economy was reformed from ground up and relations with neighboring countries were normalized to possible extent - communist Spalding, for example, rejected many contact attempts from Stephen.

There is also one person on the court, that is not happy about the coming succession, and certainly would like to rule the kingdom by himself. The sea access case returns once more, as the deal with Friedewalt has just expired, and due to Stephen's health, could not be revived; international relations are once again severely hampered by this, forcing the kingdom into hard times. The young crown prince is also viewed as weak, easy to defeat, naive and foolish; an active opposition to his future reign will possibly form after his coronation.

As the kingdom still maintains good relations with all neighbors, vision of Hartmut ascending to the throne and destroying all of his father's achievements is very terrific to even think of; that said, in an event of §Ydeath of Stephen I§! - monarch of §YCentral Kingdom§! - and coronation of §Yhis son Macius§!, Hartmut will surely take care to destroy him, as he hates him more than anything."

However, not all parts of the country are loyal to him, and royalist guerillas still roam the country, paralysing military industry.\n\nIn the meantime, Shen has already analyzed his position, and found out that his Empire is in perfect situation for expansion: §YGreenland§! is trying to stay alive while defending from attacks coming from the §YDesert§!, and §YFlower Hill§! - former §YNorthern Union§! - partially collapsed when three republics declared independence.\n\n§YThe Year of Peacock§!, as Shen dubbed the beginning of his conquest campaign, is drawing near..."

In comparison to the series, only the special crossover episode and first episode are taken as canon, in order to forge new ways for the player to create new history of EverRealm.\n\n\nOver forty years ago, §YKingdom of Avalor§! was ruled by §Yking Raul§!, and enjoyed period of peace and prosperity. This however ended in §Y1894§!, when evil sorceress §YShuriki§! orchestrated a coup, §Ymurdered both king and queen and took over the whole kingdom§!.

The secondary goal is to reopen the country for international relations, especially considering §YEnchancian direction§! and §YTri-Kingdom Alliance§!.\n\nThe future of this story from §YSecret Library§! is not certain - will it end happily?"
