English dub of the series exists, produced by Italian company Mondo TV, but only for 26 episodes.\n\n\nWhen §YCentral Continent§! was ruptured by wars, a violent revloution took place in §YNorthern Union§! - federation of squirrels, hedgehogs, ducks and turtles - which transferred the country into communist dictatorship known as §YFlower Hill§!. The reason why revolution broke out, were secret preparations of Northern Union government to intervene on Central Continent. With democracy abolished, Flower Hill avoided turbulence in the form of §Yeconomic crisis of 1920s§! and prepared for the confrontation with §YAnti-Flower Hill Alliance§!, newly formed by §YWolves§! and §YWeasels§!.\n\nTensions in the region peaked in 1932 and resulted in bloody §YFlower Hill War§!, which ended in stalemate. After §YWolves took Squirrels Village in 1935§! and kidnapped Dr Mole, §YFlower Hill Military Council§! sent §YGeumsaegi§! - the biggest Flower Hill war hero - on undercover mission to save Dr Mole. Geumsaegi's mission ended in complete success, and he returned from the secret mission in Wolves' Den, together with his brother, two friends, and Dr Mole.\n\nTheir return did not change anything, however - Squirrel Village ongoing occupation, and massive fall in the Flower Hill High Military Council popularity caused by that fact, §Yresulted in Squirrels Republic, Republic of Ducks and Republic of Turtles declaring their independence and leaving the union§!. Of those, who stayed in Flower Hill, many are still divided. To prevent Flower Hill from total downfall, Flower Hill Military Council has passed a resolution, which established position of §YSupreme Leader, together with elections§!.

These are also the main source of paidocracy (rule of children) concept, featured in the mod.\n\n\nIn the aftermath of Wars of 1910s, §YCentral Kingdom§! became landlocked country.

The young crown prince is also viewed as weak, easy to defeat, naive and foolish; an active opposition to his future reign will possibly form after his coronation.
