 ajeto.1.t:0 "An unexpected find"
 ajeto.1.d:0 "This morning, one of the mail trucks crashed while going through the mountains. The driver survived with some mild injuries, but the truck caught on fire, and only a few letters survived. However, when one of the letters was found by a government employee and delivered to post office, an unexpected sender location was identified - Flower Hill. \n\nThis was unusual, to say the least. Furthermore, the envelope was damaged, and what appeared to be GOVERNMENT SEAL of Flower Hill appeared to be visible on the letter. Curiosity and anxiousness began to overtake the employees - should they look into this letter, or should they play by the rules and try to figure out who it was for and send it?"
 ajeto.1.a:0 "It's not government's business to read people's letters."
 ajeto.1.b:0 "This could be a link to something bigger - open it."
 ajeto.2.t:0 "General Vostok's coup"
 ajeto.2.d:0 "Convoys have moved into the capital this morning, and streets have been running red with blood ever since. With General Vostok arresting and immediately executing all government officials without trial, martial law has been declared, as well as curfew. Anyone who goes outside without permission is shot on sight, no matter the age or gender. \n\nHow could we have allowed this to happen? Is this truly the end of democracy and freedom in our nation? One can only pray that a savior may rise from nothing to once again give our people hopes and dreams and crush the tyrant, because if not..."
 ajeto.2.a:0 "God save us all."
 ajeto.3.t:0 "What to do?"
 ajeto.3.d:0 "Pat and Mat couldn't believe what they were reading. They had recieved this intercepted letter of 'Highest Importance' this morning from one of the nation's post offices, and were told to look into it, as it would be a matter of national security. Now, as they had opened it and were reading through it, they realized just how tense the situation was. The letter read:\n\n Dear Comrade! Soon will come the time for your nation to join ours in the glorious people's revolution. Rest assured, when the plan to overthrow your bourgeouise bastards is set in motion, you can count on our complete support.\n Naturally, your corrupt capitalists' hold onto power will be firm, as they will dpeperately cling onto money and power. That's why you must be prepared to be ruthless. If they don't surrender - kill them.\n Do not hesitate even for a moment if bute strength is to be implemented. The fate of the revolution depends on it.\n Good luck,\n Your comrade,\n Geumsaegi\n Flower Hill.\n\n As they finished readong the letter, Pat and Mat knew - they had to act. But what would be the correct course of action - declare national emergency openly, perhaps alerting the possible participants of this plot, or to launch a secret investigation to find who could be the traitor amon our ranks?"
 ajeto.3.a:0 "Declare the national emergency and alert everyone!"
 ajeto.3.b:0 "We must be careful - launch a discrete investigation."
 ajeto.4.t:0 "The investigation begins."
 ajeto.4.d:0 "Here is our situation - if the plot is big enough to threaten our government, then one of the three powers within our nation has to be involved in it - either it is somebody in the government, somebody in the military, or someone in the opposition.\n\nWe are going to look into each of the three. For government, we will inestigate the parliament building offices for any clues, our detectives posing as janitors. For military, our detectives will pose as staff members in national defense ministry, and look through offices of our high-ranking generals. And for opposition, we will have our detectives secretely sneak into their headquarters and look for any compromising evidence there."
 ajeto.4.a:0 "Let's look into government first."
 ajeto.4.b:0 "Wait, this doesn't sound democratic at all! Call the whole thing off!"
 ajeto.5.t:0 "Report on government investigation"
 ajeto.5.d:0 "Nothing fruitful seems to have come out of out government investigation. The offices didn't contain anything out of the ordinary, and no suspicious activity could be tracked for anybody in the parliament."
 ajeto.5.a:0 "So the government probably isn't in on the plot - that's a relief."
 ajeto.6.t:0 "Report on the Military"
 ajeto.6.d:0 "Not much was found in the military headquarters. Granted, that may have to do with the fact that some of the generals had their offices locked, like General Vostok. However, we were able to ask questions to some possible witnesses.\n\nOne of the soldiers whose shift it was at the facility, Švejk, has told us with a bright smile on his face that General Vostok is completely innocent. When asked why he is so sure of that, he told us that it is beause General Vostok told him so.\n\nNaturally, this baffled our detectives. This does make General Vostok sound suspicious, but, on the other hand, this could just as likely be Švejk messing with us, to make General Vostok look suspicious. Whether or not to trust the personal account of a man with reputation of local idiot, we will decide later."
 ajeto.6.a:0 "Now, time to look into opposition."
 ajeto.7.t:0 "Investigation attempt results in scandal!"
 ajeto.7.d:0 "Investigating Opposition headquarters went terribly wrong for us - our investigators were found out, and, to keep the true purpose of investigation discrete, they stated that they were looking for something to use against opposition in next elections.\n\nThis  may have completely destroyed Pat and Mat's chances of being re-elected. However, even if it did, that's not what matters the most. What matters the most is what our agents were able to find.\n\n While they didn't find any official documents, they did find some slogans and programs of opposition, which did promote messages of equality and welfare. It does sound a little equalistic, albeit not nearly as ideologically radical as Flower Hill.\n\n With all evidence available gathered, we have little time to act, as Pat and Mat are currently sinking in media scandals."
 ajeto.7.a:0 "Winning elections is a secondary priority anyway."
 ajeto.8.t:0 "Final Decision"
 ajeto.8.d:0 "With all evidence available collected, the final decision falls to us. We have three main suspects. Our main suspect is the opposition. With their chants of equality and welfare, they sound very similar to Flower Hill. Granted, arresting them would be undemocratic, but if that's what it takes to prevent a coup that would destroy the democratic process itself, we are willing to do it.\n\n Granted, there are other possible suspects. One of them is General Vostok, who has been engaging in suspicious activity on account of soldier Josef Švejk. However, Josef Švejk isn't a trustworthy source. He may as well have been lying to us, and maybe he even did it to distract suspicion from himself.\n\nDecision time is rapidly running out, and our security forces can only conduct a single arrest operation due to being spread thin. By the end of the day, the final order of the government arrives:"
 ajeto.8.a:0 "Arrest opposition leaders!"
 ajeto.8.b:0 "Arrest General Vostok!"
 ajeto.8.c:0 "Arrest Josef Švejk!"
 ajeto.9.t:0 "Elections!"
 ajeto.9.d:0 "Pat and Mat have lost re-election to Spejbl and Hurvínek, father and son from one of the opposition parties. Many experts agree that it was the media scandal around opposition investigation that cost Pat and Mat this election.\n\nSpejbl and Hurvínek are very popular figures among the nation's people, and they campaigned primarily on balance of preserving traditional values while introducing innovations. Among their promises was contruction of many new schools, museums and theatres."
 ajeto.9.a:0 "And it's another nice morning today."
 ajeto.10.t:0 "Partisans flee into mountains"
 ajeto.10.d:0 "According to some reports, citizens who have rejected the authority of General Vostok have fled into mountains in the west of the country. From there, they seem to have begun to wage guerrila warfare against government authority. It is also likely that these partisans could be recieving equipment support from Lechia Empire, hence why they are able to put up a fight to local law enforcement.\n\nThis resistance movement appears to be led by a mysterious figure - a young military commander of exceptional skill. As he gathers his strength while hiding in the mountains, General Vostok's regime prepares for what looks like a civil war against the remnants of democratic government."
 ajeto.10.a:0 "Who does this mountain general think he is?"
 ajeto.11.t:0 "Civil War begins!"
 ajeto.11.d:0 "Clashes between forces loyal to General Vostok and democratic resistance led by Mountain General have errupted across the nation. As the capital loses connection with the western mountainous part of the country, the fate of the nation is now entirely up in the air, and shall be decided through war."
 ajeto.11.a:0 "Crush these rebels! (Play as Vostok)"
 ajeto.11.b:0 "Preč s tyranmi! (Play as MG)"
 ajeto.12.t:0 "General's contemplation"
 ajeto.12.d:0 "With main threats in our corner of the continent taken care of, one final question remains - where do we go from here? There are two possible paths that lie ahead for General. \n\nWe can keep going forward in our conquest, bringing even more nations under our control. \n\nOr, we could be more diplomatic, befriending our neighbors and focusing on internal cohesion. \n\nWhich path shall our nation choose?"
 ajeto.12.a:0 "The path of Based"
 ajeto.12.b:0 "The path of Wholesome"
 ajeto.13.t:0 "Alliance proposed"
 ajeto.13.d:0 "When Japanifornia fell to tyranny, we found ourselves surrounded and weak, outmached on all directions. Today, however, a letter arrived from a man who refers to himself as Mountain General, who offers us an Alliance to face threats together."
 ajeto.13.a:0 "Free nations together strong."
 ajeto.13.b:0 "We are not interested."
