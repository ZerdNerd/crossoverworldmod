He therefore proposed a compensation for our potential losses: \n Should we hand over those lands to Sioux, GFSU will provide us with financial and humanitarian support. Handing over our territory without any threats does seem irrational, but the compensation GFSU offers does sound nice...\n Should we accept the offer or decline?"

Now then, Yezhik, which of the two would you rather have - a small amount apples, or-\n\n But before Krosh could finish his sentence, Yezhik suddenly pulled the cart backwards, causing Krosh to fall out.

These grow in deserts! Don't you know that the sea and desert are two environments that never make contact with one another?\n\nLosyash was slowly starting to get on Kopatych's nerves with this discussion. Eventually, Kopatych turned to him:\n\n - One thing I did know from the start was that I shouldn't have invited any overly talkative nerds to fish with me.\n\n Losyash sat quietly for about half a minute, after which he smiled and continued with his usual enthusiasm -"

Do you see cumulus clouds coming from the mountains? Their outlines are sharp. This means the shepherd is happy and will not shed tears...\n - What sheperd?\n - A long time ago, someone told me about the heavenly shepherd who oversees the clouds, and cries when he loses them. They said: Do you see him crying there because of a lost cloud? And here we are forced to suffer because of bad weather! One should be more careful when it comes to tears...\n - What a beautiful legend... and yet, if I were told something like that a long time ago, I doubt I would be able to remember it...\n - Well, Sovunya, I think it's a matter of attachment to a story that decides the memory strength...*cough*\n - Karych, did you take your pills today?\n - ... I don't remember.\n - You remember hunderds of legends, but can't remember if you took your pills or not! Your mind lives in a world of fantasies!\n - My mind's been there for too long to leave it now. Thing about pills - it feels like it doesn't attach to me, as if the whole thing about cough and immunity is about someone else.\n\nSovunya sighed and smiled.\n\n - It would be nice if others had a lot of stories about us that they would remember..."

chamomilevalley.41.d:0 "It was another relatively sunny day when Krosh and Yezhik were helping Karych clean up the long untouched parts of his house. However, as Krosh was sweeping under Karych's bed, he stumbled upon something unexpected - a locked suitcase.\nKarych seemed to have no recollection as to what could be in the suitcase. Krosh then proceeded to try to open it through force, as Yezhik was trying to help Karych to remember. Suddenly, Karych's face expression changed drastically, and he ran in front of Krosh as Krosh was about to try to use a chainsaw. Karych then told Krosh to stop trying to open it.\nBoth Krosh and Yezhik noticed that something wasn't right with Karych as he said that. This only strengthened their curiosity. They didn't want to outright pressure Karych, but they were stubborn. Eventually, Karych sighed heavily.\n\n - Alright, I will tell you the truth. I don't want you to open this suitcase because... something that would lower your opinion on me could be there.\n\n Krosh and Yezhik didn't exactly understand what Karych was getting at. Karych then realized he had to elaborate.\n\n - You see, Krosh, Yezhik... It's hard to live thinking about every mistake you made in your life. So all the bad memories fade away, and only the good ones remain. Convenient, but the past always catches up...\n\nKrosh was still very much confused, while Yezhik went in trying to comfort Karych. Krosh's curiosity was still getting the better of him."
chamomilevalley.41.a:0 "- Well, what is is that could be in there, Karych?"
chamomilevalley.42.t:0 "The Suitcase, part 2"
chamomilevalley.42.d:0 "Karych sighed once more and began scrolling through his most unpleasant memories:\n\n It could be an abandoned suitcase full of money that I once found and kept without reporting... no, wait, that's not it - I lost it during my visit to Duckburg. Maybe it's a viola that I would play for natives of Tungupungu, who I had to leave behind while seeking fame? No, that's not it, either - I donated that Viola to charity auction... Oh...God... I have absolutely no idea as to what could be in there... It could be ANYTHING!\n\nKarych picked up the suitcase and ran outside. Krosh and Yezhik followed him, though they didn't necessarily try to stop him. Karych was crying out in panic.\n\n - Potential remnants of the little lies! Little crimes! Little betrayals! The things which the old heart, softened with wisdom, simply won't be able to take!\n\n He threw the suitcase off a cliff into the waves of the sea. However, as the suitcase collided with the waves and the beach stones, that caused it to open. Karych took a look at what came out:\n\n - Golly... it's... my summer underwear. My memory has failed me completely on this one.\n\n Krosh walked up behind him:\n\n - Seems to me, those whose conscience is clear are the ones with least memory issues.\n\n Karych smiled and turned around.\n\n - My young friend, you've much to learn about life. At my age, some would be happy to be able to fit all their wrongs in a single suitcase."

chamomilevalley.43.d:0 "Yet another typical day was going by at the Inquiry Office which Losyash had recently set up to assist residents of Chamomile Valley in various things. He would provide inquiries on correct time of boiling potatoes, on correct measures for constructing a kite, on the currently popular hairstyles, it was all going well... until he was approached by Krosh, who was holding a calendar sheet in hand.\n\n - Losyash, what happened on february 17th?\n - Pardon me? February 17th? Well, I think more than one historical event... why are you asking?\n - You asked me to bring you a sandwich from your house. While I was looking for it, I found this sheet, it says - FEBRUARY 17TH, DON'T FORGET. You seem to have written it for yourself, Losyash.\n\nLosyash looked at the sheet with a blank scare. February 17th... it wasn't ringing a bell at all.\n\n - Let me think, Krosh... what was I doing on February 17th... Well, I probably woke up... probably went to take a shower... probably went for a walk... or maybe not... I... I don't remember. At all. Even though it wasn't that long ago...\n\nKrosh shrugged.\n\n - You ok, Losyash?\n - Krosh, I can't believe I never realized this... I have such a mass of all sorts of figures and facts in my head... I know what happened where I have never been. With those you never knew. A bunch of all sorts of, by and large, unnecessary nonsense. But I don’t know what happened to me just a few months ago... It seemed to me that I knew everything, but I don’t even know my own life. Do you remember what happened on the seventeenth of February? Overall, how many days do you remember from your life? I only remember exactly seven. A week... Everything else is a mess of fragments. I no longer know what day I learned to swim and ride a bike. I don’t know a lot about myself anymore... Was I happier than ever on February 17th? Or, on the contrary, did it seem to me that everything could not get worse?"

chamomilevalley.44.t:0 "Request Denied"
chamomilevalley.44.d:0 " - Please, Kar-Karych! It can't be that difficult for you, can it?\n - Sorry, Nyusha, but I am not going to do this. I mean, listen to your own words - you really expect me to contact foreign governments to recognize you as princess without any legal political mechanisms and any sort of administrative mandate to power?\n - But please! I really want to become a princess! Is it really too much to ask for?\n - I am very sorry, Nyusha. Not only are there no princes around for you to try and marry, but there's absolutely nothing that can be done to entice foreign governments for such a thing. Last but not least, our country is a republic. As much as we all love you, overhauling our entire government isn't worth a teenage impulse. Trust the words of an old raven, this desire of yours will pass.\n\n Nyusha was barely holding back tears of disappointment.\n\n - Is there really nothing that you can do? Nothing that I can't do?\n\nKarych shrugged.\n\n - The one option I may suggest is for you to start performing at a circus arena, and become what is called Princess of Arena. That will both grant you adoration of many people all over the world, and at the same time won't require you to get into politics."

chamomilevalley.45.d:0 "Krosh and Yezhik were in big trouble if Pin saw what happened. Just a couple minutes ago, they requested that he finds a heating device somewhere in his dump. When Pin left to search for it, he told them to not look at the mysterious object that he had hidden under the covering nearby. Curiosity got the better of Krosh and Yezhik.\nThey were aware that this could be a bomb or something dangerous, so they used a stick to press the button on the mysterious device. However, as they pressed the button, they extended the stick too far... and knocked the device over onto the ground, causing it to break many parts.\nYezhik was ready to reveal everything when Krosh came up with an idea - he would try to fix the device while Yezhik would distract Pin. After about an hour of Krosh trying to insert various parts of the machine into other parts of the machine and Yezhik requesting that Pin brings a better heating device, eventually, Pin walked in right on the moment of them finishing their attempt at repairing.\nPin sighed:\n\n - This was going to be my surprise to all of you...\n\n But Krosh quickly ran up to him: \n\n - Pin, don't worry, I fixed it. Yezhik, activate it.\n\n Yezhik pressed the button. The device then flew up into the air, emitted bright lights, and formed a miniature black hole that began sucking up things from all over the dump.\n\nPin's jaw dropped at the sight of this. After a minute of observing the whole thing, he turned to Krosh and quietly whispered:\n\n - But it was just a juicer...\n\n Krosh shrugged with a smile:"

chamomilevalley.46.d:0 "Sovunya didn't remember how she and her house got on this cloud. All she knew was that she enjoyed her stay here. Every once in a while she had some guests. First was Kopatych who requested that she comes back to the Valley from the cloud. Sovunya declined. While he was there, she showed off some of her chores - watering clowd gardens ans sowing some cloud clothes. Next was Karych, who was very angry that she was not returnung from the clowd. During Karych's visit, Sovunya remembered something - last thing she remmebered before her house getting transported on the clowd is that she was playing dominos at home with Karych, Kopatych and Losyash. And then there was some sort of avalanche that came down. Perhaps it was the avalanche that dragged her house onto the cloud? Speaking of Losyash, he showed up next. He pleaded with her very politely to come back to the Valley.\n\n - My cloud-inhabiting friend, we are concerned for you. All of us would be very happy if you came back to us.\n - Sorry, Losyash, got too many things to do.\n\n Sovunya then took out a ladder that seemingly went all the way up into the endless sky. Losyash looked at her start climbing it and tried to convice her one last time.\n\n - Please!\n\nSovunya sighed.\n\n - Fine. I'll be there.\n\n But as she climbed back down, she found that Losyash had vanished. Worse yet, she realized she had no idea how anybody even got to where she was, and how could she get out of there.\n\n - I... I don't understand! How do I get back down from here? How? HOW!?\n\n - HOOOOW!?\n\n As Sovunya cried that out, she suddenly opened her eyes, and found her back in her house, surrounded by Karych, Losyash and Kopatych who were heavily and nervously panting.\n\n - Phew! - exclaimed Karych - Nearly lost you there.\n\n An hour and a half later, Sovunya was drinking tea on her balcony while others were cleaning up the aftermath of the avalanche. Kopatych was talking to Losyash about the size of the cabbage that he had grown in his garden. Sovunya sighed.\n\n - I too, had enormous cabbages growing in my garden.\n - When? - asked Kopatych."

chamomilevalley.47.d:0 "It all started with Karych solving a weekend crossword. Helping him out were Barash and Nyusha, who he had invited to come over to drink some tea together. For a while they were guessing words one by one without issue. But one word caused a debate: DELICIOUS BREAKFAST, 5 LETTERS. Both Barash and Nyusha had theur own versions of the answer. Barash suggested the word was TOAST, and Nyusha suggested it was BAGEL. Neither could really prove their point, as there was no answer checking sheet attached to the newspaper Karych had. Barash and Nyusha then suddenly left, leaving Karych confused. \n\nAn hour later, the two of them had returned. Barash had brought with himself Krosh and Yezhik who were on his side, while Nyusha had brought with her Losyash and Kopatych. The debate became much louder. So loud in fact, that soon Karych found himself unable to focus on the crossword. He rose from his seat and went inside his house. Meanwhile, Nyusha and Barash were getting more and more agressive, whereas Krosh, Yezhik, Losyash and Kopatych were simply enjoying the argument in a humorous manner. It looked at a certain moment that Barash and Nyusha were going to escalate this to the point of throwing tantrums, but then suddenly, Karych emerged from his house.\n\n - My friends! Calm down! I called the newspaper office and specifically requested that they tell me the answer!\n\n Everybody turned their faces towards Karych.

They are up to something, I'm telling you!\n\n A moment later, a visibly irritated Karych emerged from the bushes as well. Krosh and Yezhik were visibly confused. Krosh hopped down from the swing.\n\n - What's going on here, Karych?\n - You see, Krosh, Losyash says that he apparantely heard some dangerous intentions from your mind.\n\n - Correct! - exclaimed Losyash - Yesterday, I took a bit out of a telepathy pill which allows me to read people's minds! And I heard some horrible things from your heads!\n\n Krosh and Yezhik were dumbfounded.\n\n - What exactly did you hear, Losyash?\n - Well, I heard that the two of you were going to kill someone!\n - Correct. We were thinking about how to kill some time.\n - Alright then, but who were you going to cut? \n - We were planning on crafting a new bench for a while, and we were thinking about how we should cut to it.\n Suppose that may be true, but here's what you can't deny - you were thinking about blowing something up!\n - Not blow up, blow out! I was talking to Yezhik about how his fear of bacterias was blown out of proportion.\n\n With each reply from krosh, Losyash was getting less confident and more confused.\n\n - I... this makes no sense... the pill should have worked just fine...\n\n All the while, Karych was reading the manual for the pill.\n\n - Losyash, I think I understand the issue. You took a bite of it, instead of eating it - hence you only heard the thoughts partially.\n\n Losyash then took the remaining part of the pill out of his pocket and swallowed it. Karych frowned: \n\n - Albeit I wouldn' recommend to listening to my current thoughts about you.\n\n Losyash decided to do it anyway, and his face expression immediately changed to one taking an offense:\n\n - ME? A BUFFOON?\n\n Karych placed a tin foil wrap on his head and walked away."

I standing relatively to the swing, while moving relatively to earth-\n\n As he finished that phrase, he lost his balance and fell down from the swing.\n\n The search for Barash went on. As they were walking along the sandy coast of the sea, Losyash kept going with his tirade, when Kopatych alerted him\n\n - Look out, Losyash - it looks like a hole up ahead.\n\nLosyash smirked:\n\n - Speaking of relative points of view, suppose I put myself in Kopatych's place - spending my whole life in a garden, constantly digging holes... no wonder I'm seeing them everywhere... but in actuality, my friend, there is no ho- \n\nOnce again he couldn't finish the sentence as he fell in the hole on his way.\n\n Kopatych and Nyusha quickly ran up to the hole and looked downwards. Kopatych, extremely confused, asked Losyash: \n\n - Tell me, buddy, are you currently IN the hole... or is it just relative?\n\n Losyash looked upwards to Nyusha and Kopatych..."

Losyash approached Krosh, wanting to discuss the phenomenon.\n\n - A most bizzare event, wouldn't you agree, my digging friend?\n\n But Krosh wasn't reacting to that in any way to Losyash. He just kept laying locks around the silhouette he dug out. After about a minute of this, he turned to Losyash with a serious face expression:\n\n - They got the wrong address. They seem to have thought that some frog enjoyers live here.\n - Excuse me, Krosh? Who are these THEY you are talking about?\n - Those who sent us these frogs.\n\n Losyash burst out laughing: \n\n - Oh, my friend, you don't understand the situation, allow me to explain - there seemed to be a swamp full of frogs nearby, a tornado probably went across it and launched the frogs onto the air, and now they are falling down with other weather.\n\n Krosh shrugged with a smile.\n\n - Honestly, Losyash, the transportation method doesn't matter to me. What matters to me is that next time, they should send what is needed.\n - And what is it that you need?\n\n Krosh pointed to the silhouette, as Losyash realized what shape it was in. Krosh confirmed it with a single word: \n\n - Carrots!\n\n Losyash's smile changed to a concerned frown.\n\n - You are being delusional, my friend. Delusional and ignorant. You actually think that there's some sort of agency up there, overseeing transportation of... carrots?\n - Agency or not, I do not know. All I know is that the frog thing was an error.\n\n Losyash went home, frustrated with Krosh's mindset and behavior.

chamomilevalley.51.d:0 "Last New Year looked like it wasn't gonna be particularly interesting. If for no other reason than because there was little to no snow in the Valley. Seeing that, Krosh invited Yezhik to go to the mountains with him to get a large New Year tree. Yezhik was unsure as to what the purpose of the trip was. Krosh decided to explain his idea:\n\n - You see, Yezhik, New Year is a combination of snow, pine tree and presents. This year around, our snow equals zero - therefore we need our tree to head towards infinity.\n\n Yezhik, somewhat uncomfortable with the thought of a giant tree, asked Krosh:\n\n - Couldn't we have compensated snow with nearly infinite presents instead?\n\n Krosh shrugged with a light smile- \n\n - We should have thought of that earlier, it's too late right now. The only quick option is a big tree. \n\n On their way to get the tree, they encoutered some of their friends. What followed each encounter was this conversation: \n\n - Where are you headed?\n - To the mountains to get a tree.\n - Can you bring some snow?\n - Our hands will be busy.\n - At least a little bit of snow?\n - We can't promise anything.\n\n After half an hour of climbing the snowy mountain, Krosh saw a tree bigger than all others combined. Yezhik looked at it with unease.\n\n - Krosh, we're not gonna be able to drag that back.\n - Well, Yezhik, the eyes fear -the hands do!\n\n Krosh took out an axe and struck the tree. It didn't produce any damage. What it did produce, however, was a very loud vibrating sound. So loud, in fact, that soon Krosh and Yezhik saw something else - a massive avalance. The avalanche that followed was so strong that the entirety of Chamomile Valley would soon be covered in several meters tall snow. From under the snow, everybody dug their way up."

Unsure of what to do with the pile, he asked for Kar-Karych's advice. Karych told him the following: \n\n - My friend, you have a significant amount of material without any particular work purpose - whenever such things happen, there's one main thing you can do, that being to create art. Mold something out of this clay for others to see!\n\n Pin nodded and left. Two days had passed since that day, and now the clay pile was beginning to take shape. There was one problem though - nobody was sure what the shape Pin hd in mind was, and Pin himself wasn't present at the meeting. Then, Kar-Karych stepped forward and exclaimed:\n\n - My friends, the image Pin has in mind is obvious - a hippo!\n\n Everyone was confused by Karych's claim. Why a hippo? Karych decided to elaborate: \n\n - Think for yourselves - hippo is a symbol of inspiration, something heavy that can be lifted high into the sky, which is exactly something that could be produced by the mind of an inventor artist like Pin!"

chamomilevalley.53.t:0 "Clay, part 2"
chamomilevalley.53.d:0 "Karych looked upon Pin's final clay figure, his gaze full of confusion.\n\n - It... wasn't a hippo? It was... a boot?\n\n Pin shrugged.\n\n - Well... yes. Why are you asking? Does it not look good?\n\n Karych noticed that his words seemed to make Pin upset. He immediately moved in to reassure him: \n\n - Well, why... The sole is very expressive, the heel seems to hint... An elegant tail... in the sense of laces! But you must agree that a hippopotamus would be more relevant. It's just that we were set to see the hippopotamus...\n\n...\n\nYou are probably thinking: how funny Karych is, he thought the shoe was a hippopotamus. And I’ll tell you this: we all try to do something, sometimes without even understanding what and why. Some people don’t even need a bench for the purpose of sitting on it. And it’s good that there are people like Karych who find something beautiful and interesting in our obscure creations. Sometimes even more interesting than it should be. And from our lives, we are all also trying to create something that is not devoid of meaning, but not everyone can see this meaning. And Karych will see a hippopotamus in any of your piles, and even something better. And he will say: What a masterful touch, what an expressive line. The upper part is not very good yet, but it’s not scary..."

chamomilevalley.54.d:0 "Losyash was woken up in the middle of the night by the massive explosion in his backyard. When he ran outside, he beheld an incredible sight - a huge, white-colored, flower-like structure emitted light and produced a wonderful melody. Being a scientist, he immediately began studying this product of what he logically concluded was an asteroid. The analysis went on for several days. During daytime, he would get visited by Kopatych. Kopatych was very skeptical of all of Losyash's observations:\n\n - Losyash, just forget it. It's just a regular weed, nothing special about it...\n\n Losyash turned around to Kopatych:\n\n It IS special! ... It shines in the dark.\n\n Kopatych shrugged.\n\n - Well, if you say so...\n\n Kopatych then left, mumbling to himself about how Losyash may or may not have lost his screws from all his work.\n\nDays went on. Research continued. However, with every new observation, Losyash was starting to get more angry - this flower thing, nothing about it... made any sense. It literally defied all laws of logic. Trying to write another report, he finally snapped:\n\n - THIS SIMPLY CAN'T BE! This... this can't be... haha! Of course, it can't be! It can't be!\n\n Laughing, he hopped outside. But as he opened the door, once again, he saw the flower. Furious, he ran away. He came back in an hour, riding a huge tractor...\n\n Next morning, Kopatych found Losyash lying on the ground next to the machine. After Kopatych helped him regain consciousness, Losyash struggled to put words together: \n\n - I... I removed it... It... it didn't make sense.\n - Well of course it didn't, Losyash! Weeds never make sense, here, let's get you back on your feet...\n\n It was the first quiet morning in a while. Losyash walked of his house onto the hill. With him he carried two things - audio recorder and flashlight. He sat down on the grass of the hill, and pressed the button on the audio recorder, which recorded music of the plant..."

chamomilevalley.55.t:0 "Which game to play?"
chamomilevalley.55.d:0 "It was another bright day when Krosh, Yezhik, Barash and Nyusha were playing Volleyball on the grassy field. As the game was reaching it's conclusion, a debate began on what to play next.\n\n - Let's play football next!\n - Nah, a game of tag is better!\n - How about hide n seek instead?\n\n The debate went on for some time, as Krosh was sarting to get more quiet with each option suggested. The suggestions from others kept coming: Tug of war, Capture the flag, Twister, Simon says...\n\n - Stop it! Please! Stop it now!\n\n As Krosh cried out those words, everyone was left confused. They saw that krosh was visibly upset. Krosh walked up to his friends.\n\n - I just realized, listening to all your suggestions - If we were to play football, we wouldn't be able to play basketball. If we were to play Hide n seek, we wouldn't be able to play tag. If we were to play Capture the flag, we wouldn't be able to play Twister. And it's not just about games we play - it's about conversations we have, work we do, things we eat... Golly, how have I never realized this sooner? Our entire lives..."

chamomilevalley.56.d:0 "Kopatych needed help to dig up the garden in his backyard. As much as Karych who he had over was willing to help, he simply couldn't due to issues with his back. That's when they spotted Krosh and Yezhik walk by Kopatych's house. The two had shovels and metallic detectors. They said they had read the newspaper about gold on Tungupungu and were wondering if there are any treasures hidden in the Valley. Karych then suggested an idea to Kopatych - to tell Krosh and Yezhik that Kopatych had treasure burried somewhere in his garden. Krosh and Yezhik immediately got to work, with Karych providing motivation support so that claims of treasure woudn't come under doubt. Kopatych went inside his house to prepare some tea for everyone, but when he came back, he dropped the tray with cups due to shock from what he saw - instead of his garden, there was now a hole going several meters below the ground. And at the bottom of the ground was what appeared to be an ancient temple. Kopatych grabbed his head in panic:\n\n - Godness, why did I ever lie about there being a tresure here?\n\n he was then approached by Karych from behing, who patted him on the shoulder:"

chamomilevalley.57.t:0 "Archeology, Part 2"
chamomilevalley.57.d:0 "karych walked down into the hole where Krosh and Yezhik were digging out the temple. They were already fantasizing about setting up an archeological museum on the location:\n\n - We'll be handing out slippers to all visitors!\n - And tickets too!\n\n Karych then recommended to go wider with the digging process. But as Krosh started digging a new hole with his shovel, a crack began to form in the ground, forming all the way up to where Kopatyh's house.\n\nLuckily, everyone managed to get to a stable high ground, but everything else collapsed, including Kopatych's house, which fell all the way underground. Krosh turned to Kopatych:\n\n - Kopatych, don’t be upset! Yes, the house may have sunk into the ground. But when they dig it up three hundred years later, imagine how much joy the people will have!\n\nKarych joined in on the discussion.\n\n - No. Three hundred years is not enough, but in SEVEN hundred years this shack... I beg your pardon, this house will be of some value for excavations.\n\n Yezhik also joined in with excitement:\n\n - They will turn it into a museum. They will give out slippers...\n\nSuddenly, Kpatych gasped: \n\n - Oh my God! I didn't take out the trash can this morning! You should have at least warned me! I wish I could clean it up a little. Otherwise they will really dig up, find all this mess of mine and..."
chamomilevalley.57.a:0 "Oh-oh! How awkward it will be..."
chamomilevalley.58.t:0 "Her name was Nyusha"
chamomilevalley.58.d:0 "A couple days ago, Krosh and Yezhik noticed that Nyusha had a new quirk of her personality develop - switching names. They first noticed it when they requested that she fetches them the grass hockey ball that flew out of the field, and she responded by telling them that they should refer to her as Cornelia. Then, while they were on a swing, she once again approached them, requesting that they call her Jakonda. She kept changing her names during every single encounter they had, main reason for that being that each name had a different meaning, a different trait of Nyusha's personality that she wanted to describe. Cornelia was to describe her gracefulness, Jakonda was to describe her being joyful, at a certain point she even went for the name Inga, which meant Winter, and even considered the name Policarp, until Yezhik told her that it was a male name. Krosh reached his breaking point when he saw Nyusha walk right after them. He turned around to confront her: \n\n - Please stop that, Nyusha.\n\n Nyusha responded:\n\n - My name is Amina, which means Loyal.\n\nKrosh snapped.\n\n - AND MY NAME IS KROSH! WHICH MEANS QUIT FOLLOWING US!\n\n Nyusha took a couple steps back from shock, and fell into a puddle. Then, tears began streaming down her face.\n\n - I don't know what to do anymore! Which name do I use? I can't pick one and give up all others!\n\n Krosh felt bad about pushing Nyusha to the point of tears. He walked up to her and decided to comfort her:\n\n - Well, don't worry. I'm sure we'll be able to figure something out, all of us. Right, Yezhik? Or are you now using a different name too?\n\n Yezhik, who was watching the whole thing happen quietly up until now, took off his glasses, rubbed them clean, and put them back on:"
