 CGATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Eastern Turmoils"
 CGATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. The ceasefire in Greenland is very fragile, and provocations are staged by Humsin everyday. In the north, the Anti-Flower Hill Alliance made their move and took Squirrels Village without response from Flower Hill. Finally, the rule of king of Central Kingdom, Stephen I, is coming to an end. The only peaceful place now seems to be EverRealm, but in such global circumstances, this is also unsure."
 MAI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the aftermath of War of 1912, Central Kingdom lost sea access to its neighbor; immediately after, the country was struggling to keep the economy from falling apart. With king Stephen I ascension to the throne in 1923, the situation has calmed down, strained relations with the neighbors returned to normal, and there was relative stability in the kingdom. However, doctors discovered that Stephen is deathly ill, and will inevitably die soon.\n\nWith the prospect of king's only son, 8 year old Prince Macius, assuming the throne in coming year, country's future is rather not viewed in positive colors."
 GRN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "8 years after the signing of Greenland Treaty and beginning of period of peace with Iceworld and snowman Arktos, the Duchy of Greenland is not enjoying its situation. The stability has been severely shaken in 1935, when the sandman known as Humsin seized half of the country due to the rapid desertification, and exploits the cold war with Greenland and its Crown Prince, Tabaluga; however, the young dragon doesn't fall for his traps.\n\nWith dark clouds gathering over the Last Dragon, the question of dragon race surviving the next ten years is still open."
 ICW_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the signing of Greenland Treaty in 1928, Iceworld lost all of its lands except of one ice field and its floating capital, Glasstown, thus suffering the biggest defeat under regime of Arktos in the history. Since then, the Lord of Ice is continously searching new ways to regain lost territories and glory. Long has he waited, as the situation finally started somehow playing into his hands - Greenland has been severely weakened when Humsin seized half of the country.\nWith the Last Dragon having to fight at least on two fronts, Arktos may not have such chance at regaining his glory in the future."
 FRI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since reconnection of southern lands with the heart of country in 1918, Friedewalt's Kingdom is enjoying its golden years: colonization progress headed by Crown Prince Hartmut, new trade treaties and normalization in relations with Central Kingdom resulted in full treasury and stable political landscape, with national wealth still growing.\nHowever, no person is able to stop time; Friedewalt is visibly ageing. It wouldn't be so dangerous, if his son, Crown Prince Hartmut, did not aim beside the colonization plans and wasn't such unpredictable person as he is now, placing nation's future on the crossroads."
 ENC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "King Roland II Winslow rules the Kingdom of Enchancia for 12 years, and with his rule, the country is enjoying period of golden decade, as is the whole EverRealm thanks to his and his family' decisions and actions in recent years, with liberation of Kingdom of Avalor from tyranny being the latest development in the region.\nThe main problem, that can endanger the Royal Family and Kingdom's stability, is the matter of succession; however with all three children of Roland and Miranda being still young and the king not feeling to depart anytime soon, this won't cause problems to the nation in coming years."
 FLO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With Squirrels' Village taken by Wolves and three nations breaking away from the country on the eve of 1936, Flower Hill is in its lowest point in history, with the possibility of losing actual independence being nearly certain by many observers.\n\nTo counter this, the Military Council, which ruled over the country for the recent 4 years, announced to the surprised community that the elections of Supreme Leader of Flower Hill will be held in 1936; the elected Leader is supposed to bring the nation back to its glory, but nobody is absolutely sure that this will happen."
 TSA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Federation of the Tri-State Area, being located on important crossing between seas, is in the middle of prosperity era, thanks to the policies of its President, Roger Doofenshmirtz. Traffic going through Danville Canal generates enormous income, and the top government circles - with President himself - began thinking about starting a colonization campaign.\nThe only obstacle in the way are the coming Presidential Elections of 1936; Roger Doofenshmirtz will of course run for reelection, but with his brother Heinz announcing his bid and steadily gaining popularity, the future of Federation seems not so certain."
 GON_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After returning from the exile, Lord Shen changed the country of his ancestors into bloody dictatorship, with using capital punishment every single day. Many of Gongmen citizens had fled across Greenland Bay and Midlands River before the borders and ports were closed. Those who stayed, are forced to be fully loyal to the new ruler of Gongmen, or face punishment.\n\nThe evil peacock has plans of conquering whole Eastern Continent, effectively enslaving everyone living there, while not hesitating to throw all of his subjects into the meat grinder just to appease his hunger of conquests."
 DES_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After taking over the half of Greenland, Humsin has fortified his positions and exploits the cold war with the Duchy to prepare for final showdown. The nation led by the Last Dragon isn't the only important matter for the sandman; in the south, the brave Sioux continue to roam on the Great Prairie and wait for their occassion to regain northern lands taken by Humsin during desertifiaction of Greenland, and in the northeast, a small tribe may be the 'free entry card' to the heart of Eastern Continent.\nWhich way of expansion will Humsin choose? No one knows."
 DUL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the foundation of his rule in Duloc being concrete, Lord Farquaad began the execution of his plan to eliminate everything that has any connection to the world 'fairytale'. His efforts to break into EverRealm, even after his kind petition to king Roland II of Enchancia to include Duloc as part of EverRealm has been refused, will continue; however, with Enchancia being in its prime, this seems to be a very distant future.\nIn the meantime, the Lord plans to conquer neighboring states and flank the desired region from the sea, and when the occassion presents itself - to strike at EverRealm countries with maximum power available."
 JPN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Japanifornian Republic is preparing to celebrate 20 years of independence - however, with Japanifornian executive power being overseen by Bar Association (which also oversees lawyers in the country), this is a clear illusion.\nWith executive power being de facto controlled by courts, the nation is in dangerous situation where instead of trias politica model, there are only two branches of power.\n\nThe coming Presidential Elections of 1936 feature two prominent lawyers, and it is certain that either choice will change the future of Japanifornia."
 LEC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the War of 1912, Lechina Empire has been drastically robbed from many of its lands, which today belong to the three republics - Empire's eastern neighbours. The effects of political earthquake caused by the Treaty of 1916 are still visible to date; the calls for democratization are getting stronger and stronger every month, while the military generals present more and more radical proposals to end the crisis.\n\nIt's up to King Lech I the Great how these issues will be addressed, or the country will collapse into a civil war without end."
 AVA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After overthrowing Shuriki from the throne, Princess Elena can finally prepare to be the Queen of Avalor, but there still are some obstacles still on the way: the rule of the evil sorceress left severe impact on the kingdom with bills and laws trashing tradition and forbidding any magic in the Kingdom - that is home of all magic in EverRealm - still being in force. With this in mind, the military is still being corrupt by Shuriki's influence.\n\nOnly time will tell, if Elena is actually ready to be the Queen of Avalor, or not."
 KPT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With Starfleet arrival and settlement in the Southern Rim of Central Continent, the fight with Aliens has been brought from Kurvix Galaxy to Earth. Cautious Starfleet Admiral now has to deal with another front, far away from Kurvix, yet on the other hand, more peaceful due to full control of supply routes to Earth, which thwart any Alien attempt of expansion on the foreign planet.\n\nIt is unknown, how the conflict will reflect on rest of Earth..."
 SKO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Sancti Magistri, also known as Alien Sultan, wanted to colonize, and, in hindsight, conquer Earth. However, together with his colonists, Starfleet established its own colony on Earth and is actively thwarting any Alien communication between the colony on Earth and Kurvix Galaxy.\n\nNow it is time for Sancti Magistri, to either survive on Earth and conquer everything, or get the hell out of here before everything collapses."
 SLD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Communist regime that ruled Spalding since 1925 is finally down, and it is time for new opening in the Republic. There are many ways the country can follow, but each of them is dangerous and is unknown for many experts out there. Will communist regime triumph once again, or will democracy survive? Maybe the Pope will turn the country into his personal Empire? Or will a businessman use his connections and power to take over the country?\n\nThe book of Spalding's future is open and ready to write the next chapter."
 SAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It's been 10 years since San Escobar declared its independence, and the junta led by Zbigniew Stonoga has decided to organize long-promised elections in the country, with democratic wing still searching for their candidate and leftist Honesty Party' leader Paweł Kozioł taking the only possible chance to become the President.\n\nHowever, with elections in the former metropole, nothing is known in terms of San Escobar's future for sure..."
 DIO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In one of the most unknown regions of the world, Dio Brando - a vampire thought to be dead - has established his own realm...\n\nAnd that's literally everything that's known about this country, with bits of additional knowledge being launched via the radio waves by Joestar Family, who are Dio's archenemies. They also claim that Brando wants to conquer the whole world, and will not stop before he gets what he wants."
 SIO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Decades after settling on the Great Prairie, and 27 years after First Sioux War, the United Sioux Tribes' existence is once again threatened. As their longtime ally, Duchy of Greenland, was torn apart by Humsin and his desertification, he also plans the conquest of Sioux lands as a whole. Meanwhile, the Colony of Neu Flensburg, established partially on the lands owned by Sioux, still wants to expand to the Prairie.\n\nWith such setting, Sioux can only count on themselves, or the cooperation of their young generation with their northern ally and friend..."
 JOJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Not knowing how exactly they found themselves and their new Family Mansion in current location, the Joestar Family headed by Jonathan Joestar has one certain goal: to stop Dio Brando, the family' archenemy, from taking over the whole world.\n\nAs the family prepares for the inevitable, the radio station in the Joestar Mansion continues to air everything they know about Dio and his minions - maybe someone will use that knowledge in the future, if Joestars fall in the battle..."
 TIG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It is not known how did Tiger Clan survive in such state throughout the centuries - one of possible explanations is that they don't allow any outside contact into their territory, eliminating everyone that crosses their borders - that is, if anyone wanted to cross the border since 1800s.\n\nLittle is known about their current internal situation, but there are doubts that anything will change soon."
 FLE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The First Sioux War, which allowed colonists from Friedewalt's Kingdom to establish a proper settlement in the region, marks the starting point of Neu Flensburg history. Since that day, the Colony of Neu Flensburg took over every empty island in the region, no matter the size. Sparsely populated by the colonists, with laws blocking natives' possible uprising, it is presented in metropole as 'the land of opportunities'.\n\nHowever, Pantmawr's policy on the colony and worsening condition of colonists slowly turns them toward something they did not think of before: independence..."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC_TCW:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by Wars of 1910s, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
