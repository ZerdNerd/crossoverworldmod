   arendelle.5.d:0 "In the kingdom of Arendelle, King Agnarr and Queen Iduna preside over a realm that appears peaceful, but within the royal palace, a deep sense of isolation has already taken hold. The royal family bears a heavy secret: Elsa, their eldest daughter, possesses the power to control ice and snow. After a devastating accident with her younger sister, Anna, the king and queen erased Anna's memory of Elsa's magic and imposed strict isolation on Elsa to keep her powers hidden. This decision has created an atmosphere of quiet seclusion, where the weight of their secret and the distance it has created within the family cast a shadow over their reign."
   arendelle.5.a:0 "...I see."
   arendelle.6.t:0 "Separated Sisters"
   arendelle.6.d:0 "The two princesses of Arendelle, Elsa and Anna, have been separated since childhood due to a tragic accident that revealed Elsa's powers. When Elsa's abilities manifested and accidentally harmed her younger sister, King Agnarr took drastic measures to protect both the family and the kingdom. Anna's memories of the event were erased, and the sisters were kept apart, growing up in near-total isolation from each other. This separation has strained their once-close bond, leaving both longing for the connection they once had but unable to bridge the gap created by secrecy and fear."
   arendelle.6.a:0 "Do you wanna build a snowman?"
   arendelle.7.t:0 "Growing Dissent?"
   arendelle.7.d:0 "The kingdom of Arendelle is experiencing a rising tide of dissatisfaction with the monarchist regime. Once cherished for their wisdom and guidance, the royal family now faces increasing criticism from the very people they are sworn to protect. The isolated rule and perceived indifference of the palace have fueled a growing discontent among the populace, who yearn for a government that reflects their voices and struggles.\n\nIn the distant region of Holkestad, this unrest has found a powerful advocate in Governor Hüèy Lânge. A charismatic and influential leader, Lânge has become a beacon of hope for many, speaking out boldly against the monarchy’s failings. He argues that the time has come for Arendelle to embrace a government by the people, where the needs of the many outweigh the privileges of the few. His impassioned speeches and unwavering stance have garnered him a large following, with many looking to him as a potential leader in the fight for a more just and representative governance.\n\nAs whispers of rebellion begin to spread from the remote villages to the heart of the capital, the future of the kingdom hangs in the balance."

arendelle.1.d:0 "People of Arendelle,\n\nFor too long, we’ve watched our nation fall into the hands of rulers who hide behind palace walls, blind to the struggles of the common folk. The throne grows colder by the day, detached from the beating heart of the country. They’ve turned a deaf ear to our cries, content in their isolation, while the rest of us toil under the weight of their indifference.\n\nBut no more! The time has come for the people to take back what is rightfully ours. The kingdom doesn’t belong to a select few, tucked away in their grand halls — it belongs to all of us. We will no longer stand by as they squander our future. We will rise, shoulder to shoulder, and build a government by the people, for the people. A government that listens, that cares, and that fights for every man, woman, and child in this land.\n\nLet the winds of change sweep through Arendelle. Let our voices ring louder than the bells in the highest tower. Together, we will reclaim our nation and forge a new dawn—a dawn of true freedom, justice, and equality for all."

Despite the valiant efforts of the crew, the ship was lost to the relentless waves, claiming the lives of the beloved monarchs. The news of their tragic passing has sent shockwaves throughout the kingdom.\n\nA solemn state funeral was held, with the entire nation in mourning. The royal court has quickly formed a Regency Council to govern in the absence of the late King and Queen, ensuring stability until Princess Elsa comes of age to ascend the throne. However, the sudden loss of leadership has led to a growing sense of unease among the populace. Public unrest is on the rise, with whispers of dissatisfaction and fear spreading through the streets of Arendelle."

arendelle.3.d:0 "On the day of Princess Elsa's coronation as Queen, an unexpected event occurred. During the celebration, Elsa’s latent magical abilities—specifically her power to control ice and snow—were accidentally revealed. This caused significant disruption at the coronation, leading to Elsa fleeing the capital. In the aftermath, Queen Elsa established an ice palace in the wilderness, distancing herself from the kingdom. Her abrupt departure led to a series of challenges within Arendelle. Meanwhile, Princess Anna, Elsa's younger sister, took initiative to bring her back. Despite facing various obstacles, including severe weather and hostile encounters, Anna managed to find Elsa. Efforts were then made to resolve the crisis and restore stability to the kingdom. Queen Elsa ultimately returned, and with the help of her sister and allies, she managed to bring an end to the crisis caused by her powers. The kingdom of Arendelle is now focused on recovering from these events and moving forward."

arendelle.8.t:0 "Kingfish triumphs!"
arendelle.8.d:0 "The anti-monarchist uprising led by Hüèy Lânge has emerged victorious after a brutal civil war that has left the kingdom of Arendelle in turmoil. The forces loyal to the regency have been decisively defeated, and the town of Arendelle has fallen into revolutionary hands. Lânge’s supporters, bolstered by widespread public dissatisfaction with the monarchy, now control the heart of the kingdom. \n\nThe regency has been dissolved, and the monarchy abolished. With the old order shattered, Hüèy Lânge and his followers stand ready to establish a new government, one that promises to reflect the will of the people and bring about a new era for Arendelle."
arendelle.8.a:0 "None shall wear a crown."
arendelle.18.t:0 "Springtime in Arendelle!"
arendelle.18.d:0 "Today, in a surprising development, King Hans has made an announcement to the people of Arendelle. \n\nBy royal decree, a new government branch shall be formed - a Constituent Assembly, which shall be elected by the people through a free and fair election, and which shall henceforth be in charge of creation of laws. \n\nAmong the first orders of business for the Assembly will be creation of the Arendelle Constitution. His Majesty has endorsed proposals of limiting the executive powers of the monarch and guaranteeing many freedoms for the people of Arendelle, such as Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Assembly, Freedom of Religion and Freedom to Petition the Government. \n\nThis comes as a major surprise to critics of the King, who had previously accused him of tyrannical methods he implemented to deal with the aftermath of his rise to power."
arendelle.18.a:0 "...Was this his endgame all along?"
arendelle.20.t:0 "Dissent against the King brutally suppressed!"
arendelle.20.d:0 "Arendelle’s streets bear a grim silence today following King Hans’ decisive action against dissenters seeking to undermine his authority. Royal guards launched coordinated raids on suspected rebel strongholds across the kingdom, arresting scores of individuals accused of fomenting unrest.\n\n Witnesses report that the guards acted with precision and force, detaining opposition figures, confiscating contraband, and dismantling underground printing presses used to distribute anti-royalist propaganda. In a statement issued from the castle, King Hans declared that these measures were necessary to protect Arendelle from the chaos of rebellion and the specter of civil war.\n\nThis crackdown comes after years of rebuilding from the devastating civil war that engulfed Arendelle following the deaths of King Agnarr and Queen Iduna. Under King Hans’ rule, the kingdom has experienced enforced stability through strict laws and expanded surveillance. Critics, however, argue that his methods suppress freedoms and breed resentment, though few dare to voice such opinions publicly. \n\nThe palace insists that these measures are temporary and will ensure the kingdom remains united. Yet, as fear grips the land, some wonder if Arendelle has traded one form of chaos for another."

After all - I took good care of them during the Winter Crisis. But it seems I was wrong...\n\nI can't pretend like I don't know what caused all of this. I'm still haunted by the nightmares. Every night, I am crushed by guilt for what I did. Did I want to be King that much? Was it worth it?\n\n Well, regardless of all that got me to this point, I *am* King. So it has to be worth it. I'll make it worth it. I will show them, I can do so much good for them, more than they could imagine... but not yet.\n\n Right now, the Kingdom needs strength. Law and Order. It needs a firm hand to prevent it from backsliding into what it had gone through not that long ago...\n\nUnless we take action, we could be facing a new Civil War... no... no, we can't allow that.

Lânge himself seems to have vanished without a trace and is presumed dead. As the brutal civil war finally comes to an end and reconstruction of the nation begins, the regency council has their work cut out for them.\n\nThe process of reconstruction will take a while.

But by the end of the day, chaos ensued - when Princess Anna expressed to Queen Elsa her intention to marry Prince Hans, who she had met earlier that day, an argument broke out, which resulted in Elsa accidentally revealing her powers.\n\nThe Queen, fearing public backlash for her powers, fled towards the direction of the northern mountain. Unbeknownst to her, her powers going out of control caused the Capital City to descend into a state of permanent winter. Princess Anna immediately took the initiative and announced that she would find her sister and try to talk some sense into her.\n\nAs Princess Anna has set out searching for her sister, Prince Hans in the meantime has been put in charge, and has already undertaken efforts to provide for the people, with the Castle doors being open for all seeking clothing and shelter."

Upon arrival, his small force had come across an enormous palace made out of ice, which was seemingly where Queen Elsa was hiding.\n\n As the force entered the palace, a skirmish broke out between the first men to enter and the Queen. By the moment Hans managed to make it to the room where Elsa was, she was on the verge of killing one of his men, while the second one was taking aim at her with a crossbow.\n\n Hans needed to decide quickly what to do - should he risk the life of his man and stop the second from murdering the Queen, or should he allow the second man to fire the arrow?\n\nWith less than a second to think, Hans decided..."

arendelle.10.d:0 "Prince Hans came back to Arendelle with the body of the Queen.

Majority of the public seemed to believe the soldiers' testimony, albeit some still remained skeptical.\n\nSoon after, Princess Anna had returned. Her hair had turned white and she was shivering. She requested to be left alone with Hans. After several minutes, Prince Hans had emerged from the room and announced to the members of the Regency Council that the Princess had died from injuries dealt to her by the late Queen.\n\nThe room had gone quiet. Within a day, the only two descendants to the throne had tragically died. The Council knew they only had one option left. According to testimony of Prince Hans, the last action of Princess Anna before her death was an engagement with him.\n\n As the only person with anything close to a connection to the family, Hans shall be declared the new King..."

Meanwhile, Princess Anna—desperately seeking to thaw her frozen heart caused by an accidental icy strike from Elsa from earlier encounter, learned that true love was her only salvation. Racing against time, Anna was betrayed by Hans, who shockingly revealed his ambitions to usurp the throne. He left Anna to die while framing Elsa for treason.\n\nThe climax unfolded when Hans confronted Elsa on the ice, falsely claiming Anna had perished because of her. Devastated, Elsa’s grief unleashed a powerful storm, but Anna’s courageous act saved the day. In a moment of selfless love, Anna shielded Elsa from Hans’ lethal blow, sacrificing herself and freezing solid. The act of true love, however, thawed her icy state, proving love’s power to undo even the harshest magic. Inspired, Elsa realized that love was the key to controlling her powers and swiftly ended the eternal winter. \n\nPrince Hans was apprehended for his treachery, and Arendelle celebrated the reunion and reconciliation of the royal sisters as peace and prosperity finally returned to the kingdom..."

He gave them everything they could ever dream of, and then some.\n\n Hans instinctively waved his hand to the crowd. He was truly the king. It was no longer about him. It was about the people. He genuinely cared about his people. He loved these people. And these people now loved him.\n\n Hans then looked up to the sky. Clear sky. Not a cloud in sight. It was going to be another wonderful day in his wonderful kingdom."
