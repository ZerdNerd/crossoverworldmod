UND_the_coming_storm:0 "The Coming Storm"
UND_the_coming_storm_desc:0 "It is 1936, and the world is at the brink of war. Ebottonia has been prosperous and peaceful for centuries at least, and the only inhabitant who truly remembers war is its king, Asgore. He is no fool, and knows he cannot understand modern war, and so he must raise to power someone who can."
UND_reassure_the_people:0 "Reassure The People"
UND_reassure_the_people_desc:0 "Asgore has led the Underground for a long, long, long, long, long, LONG time. It goes without saying that his people will be upset to hear of his plans. To this end, King Asgore will travel the kingdom and assure both publicly and privately that he will remain the final authority in government and this is simply a moderate modernisation for the good of Ebott."
UND_meet_with_undyne:0 "Meet With Undyne"
UND_meet_with_undyne_desc:0 "Captain Undyne, hero of the people, second-in-command of all armed forces, and personal friend of the King. As someone of such strong repute and great power, Undyne is a shoo-in for right-hand, and even if she's passed-over for the job her input on the situation is vital."
UND_meet_with_alphys:0 "Meet With Alphys"
UND_meet_with_alphys_desc:0 "Doctor Alphys is quite simply the finest mind Asgore has at his disposal, and practically all national research ties back to her one way or another. Though less obvious a choice for leadership, she carries the love of Undyne in her favour and will be vital for any technological modernisation."
UND_meet_with_mettaton:0 "Meet With Mettaton"
UND_meet_with_mettaton_desc:0 "Loathesome as the decadent wastrel is, Mettaton has a stranglehold on all media not directly state-owned. Entertainment, news, ego-stroking, all of it is plugged into the mainframe that is MettaTon Television. The ghostly machine is fickle and may well sabotage Asgore's image if not placated, so he'll just have to play his part in the show."
UND_ready_the_army:0 "Ready The Army"
UND_ready_the_army_desc:0 "The Royal Army is... a mess. Still reeling from the bureaucracy needed to expand it to a reasonable size, the newly promoted general staff are underequipped to say the least. Thankfully Asgore's first agenda is to rectify this with a series of long-overdue reforms, such as equipping every soldier with a rifle and inviting modern instructors from friendly nations. These however are only effective if the Army is ready for it in the first place."
UND_address_the_unions:0 "Address The Unions"
UND_address_the_unions_desc:0 "With the ongoing industrialisation of our kingdom, several artisanal groups, service workers, and most critically the CORE cooling teams led by Icewolf have formed something called a 'union'. Clearly Equalist in nature, the movement is rapidly growing and will have a clear presence in whatever path Ebott follows. Whatever happens, they should at least follow their king."
UND_install_secret_ballots:0 "Install Secret Ballots"
UND_install_secret_ballots_desc:0 "Asgore has the power and the will to make the right decision, but what good ruler does not account for the opinion of his people? Though democracy may seem strange to some, it will form an important part of society in time, as specially-chosen taskforces assemble secret ballots in strategic locations in all urban areas. It may not cover everywhere, but it's the moderate start that this country needs."
UND_hold_the_referrendum:0 "Hold The Referrendum"
UND_hold_the_referrendum_desc:0 ""Good people of the Underground, this is your king speaking. You will no doubt have noticed the strange structures that have been erected over the past few weeks through our lands. They are quite simply polling stations - I intend to hold a referrendum on who will become my Viceroy for the forseeable future, and my heir in the case of the unthinkable. Though I final decision may be mine alone, I still wish to hear the voices of my subjects on such a crucial matter. Thank you, and good evening.""
