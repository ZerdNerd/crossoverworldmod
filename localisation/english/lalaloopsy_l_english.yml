The Queen's reign is stable, the Queen herself is quite popular despite her poor temper, and yet - reforms are needed for our nation to survive.\n\nOur nation is falling behind the rest of the world technologically. There are two factions competing for influence over the development of the nation - the farmer faction and the industrial faction. Farmers tend to lean more left politically, and industrialists tend to lean more right. It is up to the Queen to decide just how far the reforms of which faction should go.\n\nBut of course, the biggest problem for our nation is the threat to the south of us - the Gongmen Empire. They will soon come knocking on our door, and we must be ready for it."

What shall our strategy be in regards to Gongmen threat?"
