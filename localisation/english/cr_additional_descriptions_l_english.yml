  POLITICS_TRACZ_DESC:0 "Once, Tracz masterfully defeated the farmer from Tulczyn, Zenon Walencik, who did not want to sell him his land, because it was his 'small fatherland' ('Ojcowizna') and his family lived there for centuries. In his intricate plan, he reported him to the state administration that he had illegally cut down trees on his field, which was true. They fined Walencik so much, that he did not get up. As a result, the land and the cottage went to a bailiff's auction, the whole village under the leadership of priest Antoni collected money to pay the fines so the land would not be taken away. Nobody knew that it was the work of Janusz Tracz, who had outbidded the offer, got what he wanted, and opened a brothel in Walencik's house gratefully named "Ojcowizna" in order to ultimately humiliate the defiant farmer. This is how Tracz Janusz, the blackest villain of Polish series, razed his enemies to the ground. A man named Waldemar Jaroszy can only clean his shoes."
  POLITICS_KIRA_DESC:0 "My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.\n\nI'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.\n\nI'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."
