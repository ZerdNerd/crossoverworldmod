  POLITICS_KAN_KARLA_DESC:0 "Even though neighboring countries experienced severe internal problems, Queen Karla's reign can be regarded as extremely peaceful and stable. With her sister unexpectedly abdicating after two years, she found herself on the throne of Kandis at the age of 23, completely unprepared for the role. During first few years, Karla focused on expansion of welfare programs introduced by her father and reformed the national education system. She also decided to marry a man from the common people, not a prince, thus further erasing the distance between royalty and citizens.\n\nThe biggest test came however with crisis that unfolded in Spalding and simultaneous revolt in Northern Calisota in 1925, as equalists' rise to power in the former and successful rebellion in the latter resulted in thousands of refugees entering Kingdom of Kandis, while local equalist and nationalist supporters tried to exploit the situation - luckily, to no avail, as queen Karla managed to extinguish potential revolts in a peaceful way, while directing massess of fleeing people to safer countries. Now, after 15 years of stable rule, Queen Karla enjoys enormous popularity among the populace, living quite a quiet life with her king and two princes, while also writing successful children books in her free time - while still keeping an eye on the dangerous situation to the south and northeast of her kingdom."
  POLITICS_PRYSSELIUS_DESC:0 "One could say that Mrs. Prysselius - who had never revealed her name to anyone - would not be a good person to rule a country like Vilvetia. However, her term as President, starting in 1933, has been a surprise to many people in and out of the country, as she managed to maintain relative stability in the Republic. Being a staunch opponent of Mortimer Mouse, it is she - not the government in Duckburg - who managed to successfully isolate Northern Calisota on regional stage, slowing down the monster that is developing in Mouseton.\n\nOn the other hand, her approach to the lower classes definitely does not win much supporters among the workers, who seem to sympathize with other, radical options. So far, her first term is regarded favorably, but no one can predict if Mrs. Prysselius manages to gather enough support for her cause a second time."
  POLITICS_MORTIMER_DESC:0 "If someone had to name the luckiest man on Earth right now, many people around Calisota would definitely choose Mortimer Mouse. With his intelligence, charisma and simply being in the right place at the right time, he worked his way up the ladder and became one of the most known politicians in Mouseton just after few years of his career. Eventually, he was among the signatories of Northern Calisota Declaration, which was de facto a rebellion against the government in Duckburg.\n\nIn the ensuing chaos and other signatories dying in subsequent fights with loyalist forces or simply vanishing in the thin air, Mortimer emerged as the one and only leader of Northern Calisota, cementing his position by capturing Nelsonville in final stages of civil war and signing a truce with Duckburg Government on his terms. A decade after these events, Mortimer aims not only to unite all of Calisota under his iron hand, but also to make his nation one of the most powerful in the region - as it should be from the beginning."
  POLITICS_EMI_DESC:0 "A single child from a family with rural origins, Stanisława Emilia Gacek - or Emi, as she is known for many people - was rather an ordinary girl that did not stood out from her colleagues at school. That is, if someone did not know about her role as the leader of Secret Supergirls Club, which she co-created in kindergarten years back. While it may sound like a joke, the organization is completely serious - among others, it was the group's actions that allowed Prof. Ferdynand Kaganek to reach significant achievements in nanotechnology. Numerous other \"secret missions\" followed since then.\n\nThe adventure with Children Parliament was set to be rather calm adventure for the group. However, thanks to her charisma, kindness and good leadership, the fortune decided to take another turn; Emi's popularity among the deputies was rising from the moment she entered the Parliament's building together with her friends. The result was an enormous support for her proposals to the new Constitution, followed by almost unanimous election as the first President of Children Republic.\n\nOn the other hand, something tells Emi that the Parliament is something more than just a place where children can decide about their matters, with someone involved in it from the beginning not having good intentions. And she would get to the bottom of it - sooner or later.\n\n§YNote: do not call her by the diminutive form of \"Emi\" or by her first or full name. Unless you want to end with a globe in your head. (We're not joking. Don't do this.)§!"
  POLITICS_FELIX_DESC:0 "Felix is one of the biggest legends among the children of both Central Kingdom and Children Republic, if not the whole world. His career, from an orphan and ordinary friend of King Macius to the Head of Children Parliament, is a story that one can only dream of. His position greatly increased as he stood together with children orphaned during the war with Hartmut, which led to the downfall of Macius and his rise as the father of new Republic.\n\nOr at least that's what the official story says.\nNo one knows how exactly Felix rose to the position of Macius' right hand, including Head of Parliament. Some also voice their doubts about his actual wealth and status in the last months before Hartmut's invasion, as he was never inspected in that matter.\n\nStill, Felix is hailed by many in the region as the hero of children, with his promises of freedom extending far beyond it. The actual realization of said promises could take a very dark turn - this time, for everyone."
  POLITICS_ODKRYWCA_DESC:0 "A complete no-one with knowledge. That's how many would call Jan Odkrywca before he became deputy to the First Children Parliament. This was the event that changed his life - for someone fascinated with history and being equipped with enormous knowledge unlike anyone else at his age, he managed to become one of the most prominent deputies during the few weeks of original Parliament's term. He also maintained that popularity during the war with Hartmut, very often doing everything he could in the rear, helping civilians in and outside of Lubniewice.\n\nWith the dawn of Children Republic, he did not left the Parliament; instead, he was personally responsible for some parts of the new Constitution, often taking the floor with his logical arguments. This in turn made him the first man to be elected as President of Children Republic; for many, he is viewed as a compromise candidate, a valuable alternative for legendary Felix and charismatic Emilia Gacek. With him at the helm of new Republic, the history can take many different turns - and only Odkrywca knows, exactly which turn the country will take next."

  POLITICS_TRACZ_DESC:0 "Once, Tracz masterfully defeated the farmer from Tulczyn, Zenon Walencik, who did not want to sell him his land, because it was his 'small fatherland' ('Ojcowizna') and his family lived there for centuries. In his intricate plan, he reported him to the state administration that he had illegally cut down trees on his field, which was true. They fined Walencik so much, that he did not get up. As a result, the land and the cottage went to a bailiff's auction, the whole village under the leadership of priest Antoni collected money to pay the fines so the land would not be taken away. Nobody knew that it was the work of Janusz Tracz, who had outbidded the offer, got what he wanted, and opened a brothel in Walencik's house gratefully named "Ojcowizna" in order to ultimately humiliate the defiant farmer. This is how Tracz Janusz, the blackest villain of Polish series, razed his enemies to the ground. A man named Waldemar Jaroszy can only clean his shoes."
  POLITICS_KIRA_DESC:0 "My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.\n\nI'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.\n\nI'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."
