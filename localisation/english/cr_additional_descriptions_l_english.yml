  POLITICS_KAN_KARLA_DESC:0 "Even though neighboring countries experienced severe internal problems, Queen Karla's reign can be regarded as extremely peaceful and stable. With her sister unexpectedly abdicating after two years, she found herself on the throne of Kandis at the age of 23, completely unprepared for the role. During first few years, Karla focused on expansion of welfare programs introduced by her father and reformed the national education system. She also decided to marry a man from the common people, not a prince, thus further erasing the distance between royalty and citizens.\n\nThe biggest test came however with crisis that unfolded in Spalding and simultaneous revolt in Northern Calisota in 1925, as equalists' rise to power in the former and successful rebellion in the latter resulted in thousands of refugees entering Kingdom of Kandis, while local equalist and nationalist supporters tried to exploit the situation - luckily, to no avail, as queen Karla managed to extinguish potential revolts in a peaceful way, while directing massess of fleeing people to safer countries. Now, after 15 years of stable rule, Queen Karla enjoys enormous popularity among the populace, living quite a quiet life with her king and two princes, while also writing successful children books in her free time - while still keeping an eye on the dangerous situation to the south and northeast of her kingdom."
  POLITICS_PRYSSELIUS_DESC:0 "One could say that Mrs. Prysselius - who had never revealed her name to anyone - would not be a good person to rule a country like Vilvetia. However, her term as President, starting in 1933, has been a surprise to many people in and out of the country, as she managed to maintain relative stability in the Republic. Being a staunch opponent of Mortimer Mouse, it is she - not the government in Duckburg - who managed to successfully isolate Northern Calisota on regional stage, slowing down the monster that is developing in Mouseton.\n\nOn the other hand, her approach to the lower classes definitely does not win much supporters among the workers, who seem to sympathize with other, radical options. So far, her first term is regarded favorably, but no one can predict if Mrs. Prysselius manages to gather enough support for her cause a second time."
  POLITICS_MORTIMER_DESC:0 "If someone had to name the luckiest man on Earth right now, many people around Calisota would definitely choose Mortimer Mouse. With his intelligence, charisma and simply being in the right place at the right time, he worked his way up the ladder and became one of the most known politicians in Mouseton just after few years of his career. Eventually, he was among the signatories of Northern Calisota Declaration, which was de facto a rebellion against the government in Duckburg.\n\nIn the ensuing chaos and other signatories dying in subsequent fights with loyalist forces or simply vanishing in the thin air, Mortimer emerged as the one and only leader of Northern Calisota, cementing his position by capturing Nelsonville in final stages of civil war and signing a truce with Duckburg Government on his terms. A decade after these events, Mortimer aims not only to unite all of Calisota under his iron hand, but also to make his nation one of the most powerful in the region - as it should be from the beginning."

  POLITICS_TRACZ_DESC:0 "Once, Tracz masterfully defeated the farmer from Tulczyn, Zenon Walencik, who did not want to sell him his land, because it was his 'small fatherland' ('Ojcowizna') and his family lived there for centuries. In his intricate plan, he reported him to the state administration that he had illegally cut down trees on his field, which was true. They fined Walencik so much, that he did not get up. As a result, the land and the cottage went to a bailiff's auction, the whole village under the leadership of priest Antoni collected money to pay the fines so the land would not be taken away. Nobody knew that it was the work of Janusz Tracz, who had outbidded the offer, got what he wanted, and opened a brothel in Walencik's house gratefully named "Ojcowizna" in order to ultimately humiliate the defiant farmer. This is how Tracz Janusz, the blackest villain of Polish series, razed his enemies to the ground. A man named Waldemar Jaroszy can only clean his shoes."
  POLITICS_KIRA_DESC:0 "My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.\n\nI'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.\n\nI'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."
