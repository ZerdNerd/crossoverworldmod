For La Resistance DLC owners, each level gives a §Ybuff to operatives§!. Also, in order to represent §YMulberry Harbors§! in the game, Modern technology has §Y25% buff to speed of naval bases construction§!.\n\nThe tech levels are:\n+ Middleage technology\n+ Pre-industrial technology\n+ Pre-modern technology\n+ Modern technology\n\n\nAlongside tech levels, two new resources are introduced to the game: £resources_strip|7 §YCrystals§! (not yet inmplemented) and £resources_strip|8 §YWood§! (implemented in v0.2). They will be used to produce more weapons when technology overhaul will be completed.\n\n\nThe mod features, as of v0.2, custom-designed colonization system, which allows for expansion overseas in a fashion similar to Europa Universalis IV.\n\n\n§YThe Crossover World Mod§! uses Peace Conference AI from §YKaiserreich§! and §Ycustom occupation & liberation system§! based on decisions - puppeting via peace deals is turned off globally. Because of this, §Yfull annexation of countries is required during each playthrough§!. If you do an exception, §Ryou do it on your own risk of bordergore and decisions not firing up§!.\n\n\n+ The mod does not use focus filter system yet, but its implementation is bound to happen around Update v0.2.1.\n+ If you want to request an universe to be added to the game, contribute to the mod or join the dev team, feel free to do so on our Discord server.\n\n§YThe Crossover World Mod Dev Team§! - ZerdNerd, Rokim21, Indyclone77, emmagh, Schultz, Mr. Nix, bilumi, 7 of Clubs, Yaroslav007\n\n\nPS.

The reason why revolution broke out, were secret preparations of Northern Union government to intervene on Central Continent. With democracy abolished, Flower Hill avoided turbulence in the form of §Yeconomic crisis of 1920s§! and prepared for the confrontation with §YAnti-Flower Hill Alliance§!, newly formed by §YWolves§! and §YWeasels§!.\n\nTensions in the region peaked in 1932 and resulted in bloody §YFlower Hill War§!, which ended in stalemate. After §YWolves took Squirrels Village in 1935§! and kidnapped Dr Mole, §YFlower Hill Military Council§! sent §YGeumsaegi§! - the biggest Flower Hill war hero - on undercover mission to save Dr Mole.

However, with §YStephen I§! ascension to the throne in 1923, the situation began to cool down; economy was reformed from ground up and relations with neighboring countries were normalized to possible extent - communist Spalding, for example, rejected many contact attempts from Stephen. The sea access problem has not been solved, but thanks to agreement with §Yking Friedewalt§!, goods from and to overseas countries could be imported and exported till 1936.\n\nHowever, good times, no matter how good they are, have to end - in late 1935, royal doctors discovered, that §Yking Stephen I is deathly ill, and will die§!, sooner or later. His son and crown prince, §YMacius§!, will be crowned as the next king, even if he's completely unprepared to rule the kingdom. There is also one person on the court, that is not happy about the coming succession, and certainly would like to rule the kingdom by himself. The sea access case returns once more, as the deal with Friedewalt has just expired, and due to Stephen's health, could not be revived; international relations are once again severely hampered by this, forcing the kingdom into hard times. The young crown prince is also viewed as weak, easy to defeat, naive and foolish; an active opposition to his future reign will possibly form after his coronation. Nobody knows, if the kingdom will even survive, as royal ministers were seen in the Royal Palace toasting for the 'future' of Macius' rule..."

Even §Yeconomic crisis of 1920s§! did not stop the expansion of the kingdom, which quickly defeated the looming recession. Plans of further colonization are being made, led by §YCrown Prince Hartmut§!, with creation of settlements even on §YFar East§! being considered.\n\nHowever, Friedewalt cannot stop the flow of time, and with each day, the §Ycoronation of his son§! is coming closer; it isn't a happy perspective, as the crown prince is regarded as 'totally unpredictable' in international and military spheres. As the kingdom still maintains good relations with all neighbors, vision of Hartmut ascending to the throne and destroying all of his father's achievements is very terrific to even think of; that said, in an event of §Ydeath of Stephen I§! - monarch of §YCentral Kingdom§! - and coronation of §Yhis son Macius§!, Hartmut will surely take care to destroy him, as he hates him more than anything."

 CR_WS_UNIVERSE_KAPITAN_BOMBA_DESC:0 "'§YCaptain Bomb§!' (Polish: §YKapitan Bomba§!) is an adult cartoon comprising 164 episodes and two full-feature movies, created solely by §YBartosz Walaszek§! (no seriously, this guy is a genius - he created tens of similar series all by himself!).\n\nThe show itself, while being nothing more than bizzare entertainment in the first episodes (and a hardcore reply to the decision of National Radio and TV Commission's head, who was connected with then-ruling party Law and Justice (PiS)), became one of the cult series in Poland thanks to reflecting events in the country in later episodes, like UEFA EURO 2012 (seriously, there is such story arc); suddenly interrupted in 2013, the fans have since then been demanding creation of new episodes or a closure from the creator - seemingly, to no avail. During the seemingly infinite waiting period, fans have created thousands of memes and fan works (episodes included), and this modifiaction is one of them."
 CR_WS_UNIVERSE_YAKARI_DESC:0 "'§YYakari§!' is a comic book series (or bande desinee) created by Swiss authors §YClaude de Ribaupierre§! (aka §YDerib§!), §YAndre Jobin§! (aka §YJob§!, until 2016) and §YJoris Chamblain§! (since 2016), published by Belgian Francophone publisher §YLe Lombard§!. The series, which began in 1977, has 40 parts (17 parts have been translated to English), and has spawned a franchise containting two animated series (1985, 52 episodes; 2005-2016, 156 episodes), one animated movie (2020), at least one video game for Nintendo DS, and many more.\n\nAs the comic is still being translated (at current pace, the 40th album may be translated in a few years), the 2005 animated show is being taken as complete canon; the mod takes place after its events (if sixth season will be made - looking at you, §YMr. Giacometti§!! - the mod will be adjusted)."
 CR_WS_UNIVERSE_JOJO_DESC:0 "'§YJoJo's Bizzare Adventure§!' is a manga series created by the eternal mangaka §YHirohiko Araki§!. The manga is divided into eight parts (story arcs): '§YPhantom Blood§!', §YBattle Tendency§!, §YStardust Crusaders§!, §YDiamond is Unbreakable§!, §YGolden Wind§!, §YStone Ocean§!, §YSteel Ball Run§! and §YJoJolion§! - every part's protagonist assumes the title 'JoJo' nickname; overall, there were 8 JoJos to date.\nThe manga was followed by an OVA, anime series (PART 6 CONFIRMED! part 7 when?), live-action film and numerous video games and spinoff books, making the series one of the best-known franchises in the world.\n\nIn comparison to the franchise, the mod gathers all JoJos and their allies from the first six parts in Joestar Lands, and sets them against Dio Brando and his allies ruling the lands to the northeast; the vampire once again wants to conquer the world, but this time other universes are at risk too. Pillar Men from Part 2 and Morioh town from Part 4 also make an appearance."
 CR_WS_UNIVERSE_TIB_DESC:0 "'Tib & Tumtum' is a French comic series created by Grimaldi and Bannister. Releasing in early 2010s, it currently has around 6 parts (3 are available in English), and it spawned a cartoon adaptation in 2018, consisting of 52 episodes.\n\nThe story (set in Stone Age) revolves around boy named Tib who befriends the list dinosaur, Tumtum. At first nobody believes him (as everybody thinks he created the dinosaur as imaginary friend, because every other kid has been laughing at him due to his birthmark on left eye), but with everybody being proved wrong by Tumtum appearing in person before the tribe, the friendship between the boy and his dino is accepted by the members of tribe."
